<h2 class="normal">Preface</h2>

<p>Most of us know that The Hague is somewhere in Holland; and we all
know that Queen Wilhelmina takes a beautiful picture; but to how many
of us has it occurred that the land of Spinoza and Rembrandt is still
running a literary shop?</p>

<p>How many of us have ever heard of Eduard Douwes Dekker? Very few, I
fear, except professional critics. And yet, the man who, forty years
ago, became famous as Multatuli (I have borne much), was not only the
greatest figure in the modern literature of the Netherlands, but one of
the most powerful and original writers in the literature of the world.
An English critic has called him the Heine of Holland; Anatole France
calls him the Voltaire of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Eduard Douwes Dekker was born in 1820, at Amsterdam, his father
being the captain of a merchantman trading in the Dutch colonies. At
the age of eighteen Dekker sailed on his father&rsquo;s vessel for the
East Indies, determined to abandon the business career that had been
mapped out for him and enter the colonial service. In 1839 he received
a clerkship in the civil service at Batavia. He now remained in the
employ of the government for seventeen years, being promoted from one
grade to another until he was made Assistant Resident of Lebak in 1856.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e137" href=
"#xd0e137">vi</a>]</span></p>

<p>In this important position he used his influence to better the
condition of the natives; but, to his sorrow, he soon found that he did
not have the support of his superiors. What he conceived to be right
clashed with the line of conduct he was expected to follow. In a rash
moment of &ldquo;righteous indignation&rdquo; he handed in his
resignation; and it was accepted.</p>

<p>This hasty step put an end to a brilliant political career and
entailed upon Dekker years of disappointment and hardship. Seeing that
he was pursuing the wrong method to help either the Javanese, or
himself, he immediately tried to get reinstated, but without success.
In 1857 he returned to Holland and applied to the home government,
hoping to be vindicated and restored to his post. Again he was
disappointed. The government offered him another desirable position;
but, as it was a matter of principle with Dekker, he declined it.</p>

<p>When he saw that it was useless to importune the government further,
Dekker made his appeal to the people in &ldquo;Max Havelaar&rdquo;
(1860). The book was an instant success and made the name of Multatuli
famous. Through the perfidy of a supposed friend, however, Dekker
failed to get very substantial material rewards from this work. For ten
years yet he was struggling with poverty.</p>

<p>The Bohemian life that Dekker was now compelled to live&mdash;his
family was on the sufferance of friends&mdash;estranged him from his
wife and strengthened what some might call an unfortunate&mdash;or, at
least, an untimely&mdash;literary friendship that Dekker had formed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e146" href=
"#xd0e146">vii</a>]</span>with a certain Miss Mimi Schepel, of The
Hague. The spiritual affinity between the two soon developed a passion
that neither could resist. This estimable lady, who afterwards became
Dekker&rsquo;s second wife, is still living, and has edited
Dekker&rsquo;s letters in nine volumes. Dekker died in February, 1887,
at his home in Nieder-Ingelheim, where he had lived for several
years.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Woutertje Pieterse&rdquo; story was first published in
Dekker&rsquo;s seven volume work entitled &ldquo;Ideen.&rdquo; Here it
is sandwiched in between miscellaneous sketches, essays and treatises,
being scattered all the way from Vol. I to Vol. VII. The story falls
naturally into two parts, of which the present volume is the first
part. The second part, written in a different key, deals with
&ldquo;Walter&rsquo;s Apprenticeship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A good deal of the flax, or silk, of his Chinaman&rsquo;s pigtail,
to use Dekker&rsquo;s form of expression, I have unraveled as being
extraneous matter. However, despite these omissions, it is quite
possible that some very sensitive person may still find objectionable
allusions in the book. If so, I must refer that one to the shade of
Multatuli. From his own admission his shoulders were evidently broad;
and, no doubt, they will be able to bear the additional strain.</p>

<h2 class="super">Walter Pieterse</h2>

<h2 class="normal">Chapter I</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know the year; but, since the reader will be
interested to know the time when this story begins, I will give him a
few facts to serve as landmarks.</p>

<p>My mother complained that provisions were dear, and fuel as well. So
it must have been before the discovery of Political Economy. Our
servant-girl married the barber&rsquo;s assistant, who had only one
leg. &ldquo;Such a saving of shoe-leather,&rdquo; the good little soul
argued. But from this fact one might infer that the science of
Political Economy had already been discovered.</p>

<p>At all events, it was a long time ago. Amsterdam had no sidewalks,
import duties were still levied, in some civilized countries there were
still gallows, and people didn&rsquo;t die every day of nervousness.
Yes, it was a long time ago.</p>

<p>The <i>Hartenstraat</i>! I have never comprehended why this street
should be called thus. Perhaps it is an error, and one ought to write
<i>Hertenstraat</i>, or something else. I have never found more
&ldquo;heartiness&rdquo; there than elsewhere; besides,
&ldquo;harts&rdquo; were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href=
"#pb2">2</a>]</span>not particularly plentiful, although the place
could boast of a poulterer and dealer in venison.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been there for a long time, and I only remember that
the <i>Straat</i> connects two main canal-streets, canals that I would
fill up if I had the power to make Amsterdam one of the most beautiful
cities of Europe.</p>

<p>My predilection for Amsterdam, our metropolis, does not make me
blind to her faults. Among these I would mention first her complete
inability to serve as the scene of things romantic. One finds here no
masked Dominos on the street, the common people are everywhere open to
inspection, no Ghetto, no Templebar, no Chinese quarter, no mysterious
courtyard. Whoever commits murder is hanged; and the girls are called
&ldquo;Mietje&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jansje&rdquo;&mdash;everything
prose.</p>

<p>It requires courage to begin a story in a place ending with
&ldquo;dam.&rdquo; There it is difficult to have
&ldquo;Emeranties&rdquo; and &ldquo;H&eacute;loises&rdquo;; but even
these would be of little use, since all of these belles have already
been profaned.</p>

<p>How do the French authors manage, though, to dress up their
&ldquo;Margots&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marions&rdquo; as ideals and protect
their &ldquo;Henris&rdquo; and <span class="corr" id="xd0e511" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Ernestes<span class="corr" id="xd0e514"
title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> from the trite and trivial? These
last remind one of <i lang="fr">M&rsquo;sieu Henri</i> or <i lang="fr">
M&rsquo;sieu Erneste</i> just about like our castle embankments remind
one of filthy water.</p>

<p>Goethe was a courageous man: Gretchen,
Kl&auml;rchen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But I, in the Hartenstraat!</p>

<p>However, I am not writing a romance; and even if <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>I should write one, I
don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t publish it as a true story. For
it is a true story, the story of one who in his youth was in love with
a sawmill and had to endure this torture for a long time.</p>

<p>For love is torture, even if it is only love for a sawmill.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the story is going to be quite simple, in fact
too frail to stand alone. So here and there I am going to plait
something in with the thread of the narrative, just as the Chinaman
does with his pigtail when it is too thin. He has no <i lang="fr">Eau
de Lob</i> or oil from Macassar&mdash;but I admit that I have never
found at Macassar any berries which yielded the required oil.</p>

<p>To begin, in the Hartenstraat was a book-shop and circulating
library. A small boy with a city complexion stood on the step and
seemed to be unable to open the door. It was evident that he was trying
to do something that was beyond his strength.</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand towards the door knob repeatedly, but
every time he interrupted this motion either by stopping to pull
unnecessarily at a big square-cut collar that rested on his shoulders
like a yoke, or by uselessly lifting his hand to screen an ingenuous
cough.</p>

<p>He was apparently lost in the contemplation of the pictures that
covered the panes of glass in the door, turning them into a model chart
of inconceivable animals, four-cornered trees and impossible soldiers.
He was glancing continually to one side, like a criminal who fears that
he is going to be caught in the act. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4"
href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>It was manifest that he had something in view
which must be concealed from passers-by, and from posterity, for that
matter. His left hand was thrust under the skirts of his little coat,
clutching convulsively at something concealed in his trousers pocket.
To look at him one would have thought that Walter contemplated a
burglary, or something of the kind.</p>

<p>For his name was Walter.</p>

<p>It is a fortunate thing that it occurred to me to relate his
history; and now I consider it my duty to report that he was entirely
innocent of any burglarious or murderous intentions.</p>

<p>I only wish I could clear him of other sins as easily as this. The
object he was turning and twisting in his left breeches pocket was not
a house-key, nor a jimmy, nor a club, nor a tomahawk, nor any infernal
machine: It was a small piece of paper containing fourteen stivers,
which he had raised on his New Testament with Psalms at the
grocer&rsquo;s on the &ldquo;Ouwebrug&rdquo;; and the thing that held
him fast on the Hartenstraat was nothing more or less than his entrance
into the magic world of romance. He was going to read
&ldquo;Glorioso.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Glorioso! Reader, there are many imitations, but only one Glorioso.
All the Rinaldos and Fra Diavolos are not to <span class="corr" id=
"xd0e554" title="Not in source">be</span> mentioned in the same breath
with Glorioso, this incomparable hero who carried away countesses by
the dozen, plundered popes and cardinals as if they were ordinary
fallible people, and made a testament-thief of Walter Pieterse.</p>

<p>To be sure, Glorioso was not to blame for this last, certainly not.
One ought to be ashamed to be a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5"
href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>hero, or a genius, or even a robber, if on
this account one is to be held responsible for all the crimes that may
be committed years afterwards in the effort to get possession of
one&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>I myself object to any accusation of complicity in those evil deeds
that are committed after my death in quenching the thirst for knowledge
of my fate. Indeed, I shall never be deterred from a famous career
merely by the thought that some one may sell the New Testament to get
hold of the &ldquo;Life and Deeds of Multatuli.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You rascal, what are you loitering around here for? If you
want anything, come in; if you don&rsquo;t, make yourself
scarce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now Walter had to go in, or else abandon his cherished Glorioso.
But the man who bent over the counter and twisted himself like a crane
to open the door and snarl these words at our young hero did not have a
face that advised anything like turning back. He was angry. At first
Walter had not had the courage to go in; now he did not dare to turn
back. He felt himself drawn in. It was as if the book-shop swallowed
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glorioso, if you please, M&rsquo;neer, and
here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He drew that infernal machine from his
pocket. &ldquo;And here is money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>For he had learned from his schoolmates, who had infected him with
this craving for romance, that at the circulating library strangers
must deposit a forfeit.</p>

<p>The shopman seemed to regard himself as &ldquo;sufficiently
protected&rdquo; by the sum produced. He took <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb6" href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>down a small volume, which was greasy
and well worn, and bore both within and without the traces of much
unclean enjoyment.</p>

<p>I am certain that the &ldquo;Sermons of Pastor Splitvesel,&rdquo;
which stood undisturbed on the top shelf and looked down contemptuously
on the literature of the day, would have been ashamed to bring their
spotless binding into contact with so much uncleanliness. But it is not
difficult to remain clean in the upper row. I find, therefore, that the
&ldquo;sermons&rdquo; were unjust; and the same is true of many
sermons.</p>

<p>After Walter had given his name to the man in a trembling voice, he
stuck the reward of his misdeed under his coat and hurried out the
door, like a cat making away with the prey for which it has waited for
hours.</p>

<p>Walter ran and ran, and did not know where to go. He couldn&rsquo;t
go home; he was watched too closely there,&mdash;which was not very
difficult, as the space was rather limited.</p>

<p>He selected quiet streets and finally came to a gateway that he
remembered to have seen several times. It was a low, smooth arch, where
it always smelled like ashes. Here, as a truant, he had taken that
leap! He was with Franz Halleman, who had dared him to cut sacred
studies and jump from the top of this arch. Walter did it just because
little Franz had questioned his courage.</p>

<p>To this escapade he was indebted for his great familiarity with the
prophet Habakkuk, whose prophecies he had to copy twelve times as a
penalty. Further, the sprain that he got in his big toe on that <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>occasion gave him
a good barometer in that organ, which always warned him of approaching
rain.</p>

<p>In a certain sense Habakkuk is to be regarded as marking a
transition in Walter&rsquo;s life, <i>viz.</i> from nursery rhymes to
books which deal with big people. For some time he had felt his
admiration for &ldquo;brave Heinriche&rdquo; to be growing; and he was
disgusted with the paper peaches that are distributed as the reward of
diligence in the beautiful stories. Of any other peaches he had no
knowledge, as the real article was never seen in the houses he
visited.</p>

<p>Nothing was more natural than that he should most ardently long to
talk with the older schoolboys about the wonders of the real world,
where people ride in coaches, devastate cities, marry princesses, and
stay up in the evening till after 10 o&rsquo;clock&mdash;even if it
isn&rsquo;t a birthday. And then at the table one helps one&rsquo;s
self, and may select just whatever one wants to eat. So think
children.</p>

<p>Every boy has his heroic age, and humanity, as a whole, has worn the
little coat with the big collar.</p>

<p>But how far can this comparison be carried? Where does the identity
stop? Will the human race become mature? and more than
mature?&mdash;old? Feeble and childish?</p>

<p>How old are we now? Are we boys, youths, men? Or are we
already&mdash;&mdash;? No, that would be too unpleasant to think
of.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that we are just in the exuberance of youth! We are
then no longer children exactly, and still we may hope something of the
future.</p>

<p>Yes, of the future,&mdash;when this stifling school atmosphere <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>has been blown
away. When we shall take pleasure in the short jacket of the boy that
comes after us; when people will be at liberty to be born without any
legal permit, and will not be reviled for it; when humanity will speak
one language; when metaphysics and religion have been forgotten, and
knowledge of nature takes the place of noble birth. When we shall have
broken away from the nursery stories.</p>

<p>There is some silk for my Chinaman&rsquo;s pigtail. Some will say it
is only flax. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter II</h2>

<p>Walter thought neither of the heroic age nor of Chinese cues.
Without any feeling for the beauty of the landscape, he hurried along
till he came to a bridge that spanned a marshy ditch. After looking
about carefully to assure himself that he was alone, he selected this
bridge for his reading-room, and proceeded at once to devour his robber
undisturbed.</p>

<p>For a moment I felt tempted to make the reader a participant of
Walter&rsquo;s pleasure by giving a sketch of the immortal work that
chained the boy&rsquo;s attention. But aside from the fact that I am
not very well versed in Glorioso&mdash;which fact of itself, though,
would not prevent me from speaking about him&mdash;I have many other
things of a more urgent nature to relate, and am compelled therefore to
take the reader directly to the Hartenstraat, hoping that he will be
able to find his way just as well as if he had crossed the
Ouwebrug&mdash;the old bridge.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that Walter found the book &ldquo;very
nice.&rdquo; The virtuous Amalia, in the glare of flaring torches, at
the death-bed of her revered mother, in the dismal cypress valley,
swearing that her ardent love for the noble robber&mdash;through the
horrible trapdoor, the rusty chains, her briny tears&mdash;in a word,
it was stirring! And there was more morality in it, too, than in all
the insipid imitations. All the members of <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb10" href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>the band were married and wore
gloves. In the cave was an altar, with wax tapers; and those chapters
in which girls were abducted always ended with a row of most decorous
periods, or with mysterious dashes&mdash;which Walter vainly held up to
the light in his effort to learn more about it.</p>

<p>He read to<span class="corr" id="xd0e622" title="Source: ,">:</span>
&ldquo;Die, betrayer!&rdquo; Then it was dark, and he knew that it was
time to go home. He was supposed to be taking a walk with the Halleman
boys,&mdash;who were &ldquo;such respectable children.&rdquo; With
regret he closed the precious volume and hurried away as fast as he
could, for he was afraid he was going to get a whipping for staying
away so long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will never get permission again&rdquo;&mdash;thus he was
always threatened on such occasions. But he understood, of course, that
they didn&rsquo;t mean it. He knew too well that people like to get rid
of the children for a while when they are a little short of space at
home. And then the little Hallemans were &ldquo;such extraordinarily
respectable children; they lived next to a house with a portico, and
recently they had taken off their little caps so politely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t believe that the Hallemans were any more
respectable than other boys of Walter&rsquo;s acquaintance; and, as I
would like to give some reasons for my belief, I am going to relate an
incident that had happened some time before this.</p>

<p>Walter never got any pocket-money. His mother considered this
unnecessary, because he got at home everything that he needed. It
mortified him to have to wait for an invitation to join in a game of
ball with his companions, and then be reminded that he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>had contributed
nothing towards buying the ball. In Walter&rsquo;s time that useful
instrument of sport cost three doits&mdash;just a trifle. Now I suppose
they are more expensive&mdash;but no, cheaper, of course, on account of
Political Economy.</p>

<p>On many occasions he was depressed by reason of this lack of money.
We shall see later whether what his mother said was true, or not: that
he received at home everything he needed. It is certain that at home he
never had the privilege of doing with some little thing as he pleased,
which is very nice for children. And for grown-up people, too.</p>

<p>The Hallemans&mdash;who were so especially respectable&mdash;gave
him to understand that they had no desire to bear all the expenses.
Franz calculated that Walter&rsquo;s friendship had already cost them
nine stivers, which I find high&mdash;not for the friendship, but
merely as an estimate. Gustave said it was still more; but that is a
detail. Gustave, too, had let him have four slate pencils, that he
might court &ldquo;the tall Cecilia,&rdquo; who wouldn&rsquo;t have
anything to do with him because he wore a jacket stuck in his
trousers&mdash;the kind small boys wore then. She accepted the pencils,
and then made Gustave a present of them for a kiss.</p>

<p>The reproaches of the little Hallemans, who were so very
respectable, almost drove Walter to despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told my mother, but she won&rsquo;t give me
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little Hallemans, who were so respectable, said:
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re giving us? You&rsquo;re a
parasite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the first time Walter had ever heard the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>word, but he knew
what it meant. Nothing sharpens the wits like bitterness of heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A parasite, a parasite&mdash;I&rsquo;m a parasite,&rdquo; and
he ran off screaming, making a detour in order to avoid the street
where Cecilia&rsquo;s father had a second-hand store. Oh, if she had
seen him running through the street crying like a baby&mdash;that would
have been worse than the breeches pulled up over his jacket!</p>

<p>A parasite, a parasite!</p>

<p>He met lots of grown-up people who perhaps were parasites, but they
were not bawling on this account.</p>

<p>Parasite!</p>

<p>He saw a policeman, and caught his breath when he got by him,
surprised that the man hadn&rsquo;t arrested him.</p>

<p>Parasite!</p>

<p>Then came a street-sweeper with his cart, who seemed to rattle that
hateful word after him.</p>

<p>Our little sufferer remembered that the Halleman boys had once told
him what a fortune could be made by peddling peppermint drops. For
twenty-four stivers one could buy a big sack full. By selling so and so
many for a doit, the profit would be enormous. If one only had the
capital to begin! The Hallemans had calculated everything very exactly;
for they were not only very respectable, but also very cunning.
Cunningness and respectability usually go hand in hand. They had said,
all that was needed was the capital. They would attend to laying in the
stock, and would assume all responsibility for the sale of the same. If
Walter would chip in just a florin, they could raise the rest and all
would go well. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13">13</a>]</span></p>

<p>Parasite.... Parasite....</p>

<p>Walter slipped a florin from his mother&rsquo;s box of savings and
brought it to the Halleman boys, who were so remarkably
respectable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; asked Gustave, but careful not
to give Walter time to answer, or to fall into an embarrassing
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo;&mdash;without any interrogation
point&mdash;&ldquo;fine! Franz and I will each add one like it.
That&rsquo;ll make twenty-four, and then we&rsquo;ll buy the
peppermints. There&rsquo;s a factory on the <i>
Rosengracht</i>&mdash;such a sack for four shillings. Franz and I will
do everything. We&rsquo;ll have more opportunity at school, you
understand. Christian Kloskamp has already ordered twelve; he&rsquo;ll
pay after the holidays. We&rsquo;ll take all the trouble; you
needn&rsquo;t do anything, Walter&mdash;and then an equal divide. You
can depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter went home and dreamed of unheard-of wealth. He would put a
dollar in his mother&rsquo;s savings-bank, and buy for Cecilia a lead
pencil from the man who had picked holes in the wood-work of his wagon
with them. So strong were they! That would be something entirely
different from those slate pencils; and if the tall Cecilia still
wouldn&rsquo;t have him, then&mdash;but Walter did not care to think
further. There are abysses along the path of fancy that we do not dare
to sound. We see them instinctively, close the eyes and&mdash;I only
know that on that evening Walter fell asleep feeling good, expecting
soon to have a good conscience over his little theft and hoping that
Cecilia would give him a happy heart. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb14" href="#pb14">14</a>]</span></p>

<p>Alas, alas! Little Walter had made his calculations without taking
into consideration the slyness and respectability of the Hallemans.
They lay in wait for him the next day as he came from school. Walter,
who had painted to himself how they would be panting under the weight
of the great sack; Walter, who was so anxious to know if Christian
Kloskamp had taken what he had ordered; Walter, who was burning with
curiosity as to the success of the venture&mdash;oh, he was bitterly
disappointed. Gustave Halleman not only carried no sack of peppermints.
What&rsquo;s more, he had a very grave face. And little Franz looked
like virtue itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how is everything?&rdquo; Walter asked, but without
saying a word. He was too curious not to ask, and too fearful to
express the question otherwise than by opening his mouth and poking out
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, Walter, we&rsquo;ve been thinking about
the matter; and there&rsquo;s a lot to be said against the
plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Walter! In that moment both his heart and his conscience
suffered shipwreck. Away with your dreams of ethical vindication, away
with the gaping money-boxes of mothers&mdash;away, lead pencil that was
to bore a hole in the hard heart of the tall Cecilia&mdash;gone, gone,
gone, everything lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Walter, the mint-drops might melt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s,&rdquo; sobbed Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Christian Kloskamp, who ordered twelve&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wonder if Christian was likely to melt too. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15">15</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He is leaving school, and will certainly not return after the
holidays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-e-e i-i-s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and for that reason, and also because there are not
anything like so many to the pound as we had thought. Mint-drops are
heavy. We&rsquo;ve calculated everything, Franz and I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added little Franz, with the seriousness of one
giving important advice in a time of great danger, &ldquo;the things
are very heavy at present. Feel this one; but you must give it back to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter weighed the mint-drop on his finger and returned it
conscientiously.</p>

<p>He found it heavy. Ah, in this moment he was so depressed that he
would have found everything heavy.</p>

<p>Franz stuck the piece of candy into his mouth, and sucking at it
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, really, very heavy. These are the English drops, you
know. And then there is something else, too, isn&rsquo;t there,
Gustave? The propriety, the respectability! Tell him,
Gustave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The respectability,&rdquo; cried Gustave, significantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We mean the respectability of it,&rdquo; repeated Franz, as
if he were explaining something.</p>

<p>Walter looked first from one to the other, and did not seem to
comprehend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell him, Gustave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Walter, Franz will tell you,&rdquo; said Gustave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walter, our papa is a deacon, and carries a portfolio, and
there where we live is a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Gustave, &ldquo;there on the <i>Gracht</i>,
you know, lives M&rsquo;neer Krulewinkel. He has a
villa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16">16</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;With a portico,&rdquo; added Franz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just on account of our standing&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you see, Walter? And when a visitor comes our mother brings out the
wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Maderia, Maderia! And our tobacco-box is silver,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Franz, it isn&rsquo;t silver; but, Walter, it looks just
like silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our poor little sinner understood all of this, but he failed to see
what bearing it might have on his own disappointed hopes. He stuttered:
&ldquo;Yes, Gustave&mdash;yes, Franz&mdash;but the
peppermint&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We just wanted to tell you that we are very respectable,
don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Gustave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And well-behaved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-e-e-s, Franz.&rdquo; Poor Walter!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then as you said you never got any
pocket-money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Walter&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you know? Because our papa
is so respectable&mdash;when winter comes you can see how he looks
after the orphans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he rings at every door. And&mdash;and&mdash;we are
afraid, that you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The florin&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The florin! You understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you didn&rsquo;t get it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you didn&rsquo;t get it honestly. That&rsquo;s
it,&rdquo; said Franz, sticking another mint-drop into his mouth,
perhaps to brace himself up.</p>

<p>It was out at last. Poor, miserable Walter. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17">17</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And on that account, Walter, we would rather not keep the
money, but just divide now&mdash;equally, as we all agreed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Gustave, &ldquo;divide equally. The
work&mdash;we&mdash;you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They divided the profits. And the Hallemans were sleek about it.
Twenty-four stivers; three into twenty-four goes eight times,
therefore&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Walter received eight stivers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; explained Gustave, &ldquo;we
couldn&rsquo;t do it, because our papa is a deacon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and our tobacco-box, even if it isn&rsquo;t pure
silver, it&rsquo;s just like silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My lack of faith in the extreme respectability of the Hallemans is
based upon the foregoing story; and I am inclined to think that all
this &ldquo;respectability&rdquo; of which Walter heard so much at home
was only an excuse on his mother&rsquo;s part to get him out of the
way. For there was a lack of room. If she had wanted to use Walter
about the house, it is questionable if she had discovered anything
especially respectable about those boys.</p>

<p>Many laws and most customs have their origin in a &ldquo;lack of
room&rdquo;&mdash;in the intellect, in one&rsquo;s character, in the
house or flat, in the fields, in the city.</p>

<p>This applies to the preference for the right hand&mdash;a result of
crowding at the table&mdash;to the institution of marriage, and to many
things lying between these extremes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter III</h2>

<p>We will not try to explain further this fruitful principle of
&ldquo;limitation of space.&rdquo; Walter knew the fruit of it, even if
he failed to recognize the origin. He was not worried so much by the
mere coming home as by the punishment he expected to receive as soon as
that New Testament should be missed. He had returned from his little
excursion into the country with Glorioso, and now in Amsterdam again
the memory of his recent offense&mdash;or shall I say the anticipation
of what was coming?&mdash;lay heavily on his mind.</p>

<p>If we could think away all the results of crime committed, there
would be very little left of what we call conscience.</p>

<p>But Walter consoled himself with the thought that it wasn&rsquo;t a
thimble this time. The testament will not be missed at once, he
reflected, because Sunday was a long way off, and no one would ask
about it during the week.</p>

<p>No, it was not a thimble, or a knitting-needle, or a sugar-bowl, or
anything in daily use.</p>

<p>When our hero got home, he stuck his greasy Glorioso under
Leentje&rsquo;s sewing-table&mdash;the same Leentje who had sewed up
his breeches after that wonderful leap, so that his mother never found
out about it. She <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href=
"#pb19">19</a>]</span>went down to her grave in ignorance of these torn
breeches.</p>

<p>But Leentje was employed to patch breeches and such things. She
received for this seven stivers a week, and every evening a slice of
bread and butter.</p>

<p>Long after the Habakkuk period, Walter often thought of her humble
&ldquo;Good-evening, Juffrouw; good-evening, M&rsquo;neer and the young
Juffrouwen; good-evening, Walter,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>Yes, Walter&rsquo;s mother was called Juffrouw, on account of the
shoe-business. For Juffrouw is the title of women of the lower middle
classes, while plain working women are called simply Vrouw. Mevrouw is
the title of women of the better classes. And so it is in the
Netherlands till to-day: The social structure is a series of classes,
graduated in an ascending scale. Single ladies are also called
Juffrouw, so that Juffrouw may mean either a young lady or a young
matron&mdash;who need not necessarily be so young. The young Juffrouwen
were Walter&rsquo;s sisters, who had learned how to dance. His brother
had been called M&rsquo;neer since his appointment as assistant at the
&ldquo;intermediate school,&rdquo; a sort of charity school now no
longer in existence. His mother had spliced his jacket that he might
command the respect of the boys, and remarked that the name
&ldquo;Stoffel&rdquo; scarcely suited him now. This explains why
Leentje addressed him as M&rsquo;neer. To Walter she simply said
Walter, for he was only a small boy. Walter owed her three stivers, or,
to be exact, twenty-six doits, which he never did pay her. For, years
afterward, when he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=
"#pb20">20</a>]</span>wanted to return the money to her, there were no
more doits; and, besides, Leentje was dead.</p>

<p>This pained him very much, for he had thought a great deal of her.
She was ugly, even dirty, and was stoop-shouldered, too. Stoffel, the
schoolmaster, said that she had an evil tongue: She was thought to have
started the report that he had once eaten strawberries with sugar in
the &ldquo;Netherlands.&rdquo; This was a small garden-restaurant.</p>

<p>I am willing to admit the truth of all this; but what more could one
expect for seven stivers and a slice of bread and butter? I have known
duchesses who had larger incomes; and still in social intercourse they
were not agreeable.</p>

<p>Leentje was stooped as a result of continuous sewing. Her needle
kept the whole family clothed; and she knew how to make two jackets and
a cap out of an old coat and still have enough pieces left for the
gaiters that Stoffel needed for his final examination. He fell through
on account of a mistake in Euclid.</p>

<p>With the exception of Walter nobody was satisfied with Leentje. I
believe they were afraid of spoiling her by too much kindness.
Walter&rsquo;s sisters were always talking about &ldquo;class&rdquo;
and &ldquo;rank,&rdquo; saying that &ldquo;everyone must stay in his
place.&rdquo; This was for Leentje. Her father had been a cobbler who
soled shoes, while the father of the young Juffrouwen had had a store
in which &ldquo;shoes from Paris&rdquo; were sold. A big difference.
For it is much grander to sell something that somebody else has made
than to make something one&rsquo;s self. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb21" href="#pb21">21</a>]</span></p>

<p>The mother thought that Leentje might be a little cleaner. But I am
going to speak of the price again, and of the difficulty of washing
when one has no time, no soap, no room, and no water. At that time
waterpipes had not been laid, and, if they had been, it&rsquo;s a
question if the water had ever got as far as Leentje.</p>

<p>So, everyone but Walter had a spite against Leentje. He liked her,
and was more intimate with her than with anyone else in the house,
perhaps because the others could not endure him, and there was nothing
left for him to do but to seek consolation from her. For every feeling
finds expression, and nothing is lost, either in the moral or in the
material world. I could say more about this, but I prefer to drop the
subject now, for the organ-grinder under my window is driving me
crazy.</p>

<p>Walter&rsquo;s mother called him, &ldquo;That boy.&rdquo; His
brothers&mdash;there were more beside Stoffel&mdash;affirmed that he
was treacherous and morose, because he spoke little and didn&rsquo;t
care for &ldquo;marbles.&rdquo; When he did say anything, they
attributed to him a relationship with King Solomon&rsquo;s cat. His
sisters declared he was a little devil. But Walter stood well with
Leentje. She consoled him, and considered it disgraceful that the
family didn&rsquo;t make more out of such a boy as Walter. She had seen
that he was not a child like ordinary children. And I should scarcely
take the trouble to write his story if he had been.</p>

<p>Up to a short time after his trip to Hartenstraat, Ash Gate and the
old bridge, Leentje was Walter&rsquo;s sole confidant. To her he read
the verses that slender <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href=
"#pb22">22</a>]</span>Cecilia had disdained. To her he poured out his
grief over the injustice of his teacher Pennewip, who gave him only
&ldquo;Fair,&rdquo; while to that red-headed Keesje he gave &ldquo;Very
good&rdquo; underscored&mdash;Keesje who couldn&rsquo;t work an example
by himself and always &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in &ldquo;Holland
Counts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor boy,&rdquo; said Leentje, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right
about it.&rdquo; They went over into the Bavarian house. It&rsquo;s a
disgrace! And to save a doit on the pound.</p>

<p>She claimed that Keesje&rsquo;s father, who was a butcher, let
Pennewip have meat at a reduced price, and that this was what was the
matter with all those Holland counts and their several houses.</p>

<p>Later Walter looked upon this as a &ldquo;white lie,&rdquo; for
Pennewip, when examined closely, didn&rsquo;t look like a man who would
carry on a crooked business with beefsteak. But in those days he
accepted gladly this frivolous suspicion against the man&rsquo;s honor
as a plaster for his own, which had been hurt by the favoritism towards
Keesje. Whenever our honor is touched, or what we regard as our honor,
then we think little of the honor of others.</p>

<p>When his brothers jeered at him and called him &ldquo;Professor
Walter,&rdquo; or when his sisters scolded him for his &ldquo;idiotic
groping among the bed-curtains,&rdquo; or when his mother punished him
for eating up the rice that she intended to serve again
&ldquo;to-morrow&rdquo;&mdash;then it was always Leentje who restored
the equilibrium of his soul and banished his cares, just as, with her
inimitable stitches, she banished the &ldquo;triangles&rdquo; from his
jacket and breeches. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23">23</a>]</span></p>

<p>Ugly, dirty, evil-tongued Leentje, how Walter did like you! What
consolation radiated from her thimble, what encouragement even in the
sight of her tapeline! And what a lullaby in those gentle words:
&ldquo;There now, you have a needle and thread and scraps. Sew your
little sack for your pencils and tell me more of all those counts, who
always passed over from one house into another.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
</div>

<div id="ch4" class="div1"><span class="pagenum"> [<a href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter IV</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what prophet Walter got as punishment for that
pawned Bible. The pastor came to preach a special sermon. The man was
simply horrified at such impiousness. Juffrouw Laps, who lived in the
lower anteroom, had heard about it too. She was very pious and asserted
that such a boy was destined for the gallows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One begins with the Bible,&rdquo; she said significantly,
&ldquo;and ends with something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one has ever found out just what that &ldquo;something
else&rdquo; is which follows a beginning with the Bible. I don&rsquo;t
think she knew herself, and that she said it to make people believe
that she possessed much wisdom and knew more about the world than she
gave utterance to. Now, I admit that I have no respect for wisdom that
cannot express itself in intelligible words, and, if it had been my
affair, I should have very promptly drawn a tight rein on Juffrouw
Laps.</p>

<p>Stoffel delivered an exhortation in which he brought out all that
had been forgotten by the preacher. He spoke of Korah, Dathan and
Abiram, who had erred similarly to Walter and had been sent to an early
grave for their sins. He said too, that the honor of the family had
been lost at the &ldquo;Ouwebrug,&rdquo; that it was his duty,
&ldquo;as the eldest son of an irreproachable widow and third assistant
at the intermediate school, to take care of the honor of the
house&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25">25</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of Bavaria,&rdquo; said Leentje softly.</p>

<p>That &ldquo;a marriage, or any other <span class="corr" id="xd0e857"
title="Source: arrangemnet">arrangement</span> for the girls, would be
frustrated by Walter&rsquo;s offence, for no one would have anything to
do with girls who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In short, Stoffel accented the fact that it was &ldquo;a
disgrace,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;he would never be able to look anyone
in the face who knew of this crime.&rdquo; He remarked distinctly that
the schoolboys must know of it, for Louis Hopper had already stuck out
his tongue at him!</p>

<p>And finally, that he &ldquo;shuddered to cross the new
market-place&rdquo;&mdash;in those days criminals were scourged,
branded and hanged here&mdash;because it reminded him so disagreeably
of Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s horrible allusion to Walter&rsquo;s fate.</p>

<p>Then followed all sorts of things about Korahs, Dathans and Abirams,
whereupon the whole family broke out in a wail. For it was so
pathetic.</p>

<p>Walter comforted himself with thoughts of Glorioso, and, whenever
that &ldquo;something else&rdquo; of Juffrouw Laps was spoken of, he
just dreamed of his marriage with beautiful Amalia, whose train was
carried by six pages. I fancy Juffrouw Laps would have made a pretty
face if she had learned of this interpretation of her mysterious
climax.</p>

<p>All efforts to compel our hero to tell how he had spent that money
were in vain. After all known means had been applied, the attempt to
force a confession had to be abandoned. Water and bread, water without
bread, bread without water, no water and no bread, the preacher,
Stoffel, Habakkuk, Juffrouw Laps, tears, the rod&mdash;all in vain.
Walter was not the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href=
"#pb26">26</a>]</span>boy to betray Glorioso. This was what he had
found so shabby of Scelerajoso, who had to pay the penalty, as we have
seen.</p>

<p>As soon as he got the privilege of walking again with the Hallemans,
who were so eminently respectable, he hurried away to the old bridge,
near Ash Gate, to continue his thrilling book. He read up to that fatal
moment when he had to tell his hero good-bye, and on the last page saw
Glorioso, as a major-general, peacefully expire in the arms of the
virtuous Alvira.</p>

<p>When Walter had returned the book to Hartenstraat his eye was
attracted by some almond-cakes at the confectioner&rsquo;s on the
corner. He did with Glorioso just as the Athenians did with Kodrus: No
one was worthy to be the successor of such a hero, and within a few
days the residue of the New Testament had been converted into
stomach-destroying pastry.</p>

<p>I ought to add that a part of the &ldquo;balance&rdquo; left after
that Italian excursion&mdash;perhaps the part contributed by the
Psalms&mdash;was invested in a triple-toned, ear-splitting,
soul-searing harmonica, which was finally confiscated by Master
Pennewip as being a disturbing element in the schoolroom. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
</div>

<div id="ch5" class="div1"><span class="pagenum"> [<a href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter V</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel called upon to pass judgment on the strife
between Leentje and Pennewip regarding the latter&rsquo;s partiality
towards Keesje, the butcher&rsquo;s son. But that fiery feeling for
right and justice which has harrassed me from my earliest
youth&mdash;ah, for years have I waited in vain for justice&mdash;and
the foolish passion for hunting after mitigating circumstances, even
when the misdeed has been proved&mdash;all this compels me to say that
Pennewip&rsquo;s lot might be considered a mitigating circumstance for
a man convicted of the eight deadly sins.</p>

<p>I have found that many great men began their careers as feeders of
hogs (see biographical encyclopedias); and it seems to me that this
occupation develops those qualities necessary in ruling or advancing
mankind.</p>

<p>If the theologists should happen to criticise this story, and
perhaps accuse me of far-reaching ignorance, because I enumerate one
cardinal sin more than they knew of, or of the crime of classifying man
as a sort of hog, I reply that, still another new canonical sin could
be discovered that they have never studied. And that ought to be as
pleasing to them as influenza is to the apothecary.</p>

<p>New problems, gentlemen, new problems!</p>

<p>And as for our relationship with pigs, just consider <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>the relation of coal
to diamond, and I think everyone will be satisfied&mdash;even the
theologists.</p>

<p>What a magnificent prospect anyone has who spends his tender youth
with those grunting coal-diamonds of the animal world! But I have often
wondered that in the &ldquo;Lives of Famous Men&rdquo; we so seldom
read of a school-teacher, for in the school all the ingredients of
greatness are abounding.</p>

<p>The reverse is more often true. Every day we see banished princes
teaching lazy boys. Dionysius and Louis Philippe are not the only ones.
I myself once tried to teach an American French. It was no go.</p>

<p>If it should ever become customary again to elect kings, I hope the
people will elect such persons as have studied men, just as one studies
Geography on globes or maps. All virtues, propensities, passions,
mistakes, misdeeds, knowledge of which is so indispensable in human
society, can be studied much better in the schoolroom. The field is
restricted, and can be taken in more readily. The famous statecraft of
many a great man, if the truth were known, had its origin in that old
tripping trick, which is everything to the three-foot Machiavellis.</p>

<p>The task of a schoolmaster is not an easy one. I have never
understood why he is not better paid, or, since this must be so, why
there are still men who prefer to teach, when on the same pay they
might be corporals in the army, and teach the use of firearms, which
offers fewer headaches and more fresh air.</p>

<p>I would even rather be a preacher; for he does work with people who
are interested and come to hear him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29"
href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>of their own free will. The teacher has to
fight continually with indifference, and with the extremely dangerous
rivalry of tops, marbles, and paper-dolls&mdash;not to speak of candy,
scarlatina and weak mothers.</p>

<p>Pennewip was a man of the old school. At least he would seem so to
us if we could see him in his gray school jacket and short trousers
with buckles, and his brown wig, which he was continually pushing into
place. At the first of the week this was always curly, when it was not
raining&mdash;rain isn&rsquo;t good for curls; and on Sundays
&ldquo;the man with the curling irons&rdquo; came.</p>

<p>Antiquated? But perhaps this is only imagination. Who knows? perhaps
in his day he was quite modern. How soon people will say the same of
us! At all events, the man called himself &ldquo;Master&rdquo; and his
school was a school and not an &ldquo;Institute.&rdquo; It is no
advance to call things by other than their right names. In his school
boys and girls sat together indiscriminately, according to the
na&iuml;ve custom of those days. They learned, or might learn, Reading,
Writing, Arithmetic, National History, Psalmody, Sewing, Knitting, and
Religion. These were the order of the day, but if anyone distinguished
himself by a show of talent, diligence or good behavior, that one
received special instruction in versification, an art in which Pennewip
took great pleasure.</p>

<p>Thus he taught the boys till they were sufficiently advanced to be
confirmed. With the help of his wife he gave the girls a
&ldquo;finishing course.&rdquo; They were graduated with a paternoster
done in red on a black <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href=
"#pb30">30</a>]</span>background, or perhaps a pierced heart between
two flower-pots. Then they were through and ready to become the
grandmothers of their own generation.</p>

<p>There was no natural science then. Even to-day there is room for
improvement along this line. It is said that some advance has been made
recently. It is more useful for a child to know how corn grows than to
be able to call the name of it in a foreign language. I don&rsquo;t say
that either is incompatible with the other.</p>

<p>The public schools were most deficient at the time when Walter and
Keesje were slowly crawling around the arena of honor; but I doubt if
one could say much more of the &ldquo;institutes&rdquo; of to-day. I
would advise everyone to visit such a school as he attended when a boy;
and I am convinced that after this test many a father who has the
welfare of his children at heart will prefer to keep them at home. One
comes to the conclusion, that after all in the school of clever Master
Miller, who was so clever that he got himself addressed as <i>
M&rsquo;sieu</i> Millaire, precious little was to be learned.</p>

<p>Failing to make this test we continue to believe in the
infallibility of M&rsquo;sieu of Millaire. We always consider that one
a great man whom we have known in childhood and haven&rsquo;t seen
since.</p>

<p>When I remarked a moment ago that school-teachers are paid so
niggardly, I didn&rsquo;t mean that their remuneration was
insufficient, considering the quality and quantity of the goods
delivered&mdash;knowledge, scholarship, education. I only had in mind
the bitterness of their lot, and the poor indemnity given to the man
who spends his life in a wasp&rsquo;s nest. <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb31" href="#pb31">31</a>]</span></p>

<p>In addition to versifying, Pennewip had still another hobby, which
gave him more claim to a throne than did anything else. He was
possessed with the mania for classifying, a passion known to few, but
still of not infrequent occurrence. I have never quite understood the
disease; and I gave up my search for the &ldquo;first cause&rdquo; as
soon as I saw how difficult it is to get around with a hobby-horse
taken from somebody else&rsquo;s stable. So I am going to give only a
short sketch of Pennewip&rsquo;s harmless animal.</p>

<p>Everything that he saw, perceived, experienced he divided into
families, classes, genera, species and sub-species, and made of the
human race a sort of botanical garden, in which he was the <i>
Linne</i>. He regarded that as the only possible way to grasp the final
purpose of creation and clear up all obscure things, both in and out of
school. He even went so far as to say that Walter&rsquo;s New Testament
would have turned up again if Juffrouw Pieterse had only been able to
tell to what class the man belonged who had bound the volume in black
leather. But that was something she didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>As for myself, I shouldn&rsquo;t have said a word about
Pennewip&rsquo;s mania for classifying everything, if I hadn&rsquo;t
thought it might help me to give the reader a better picture of our
hero and his surroundings. I should have preferred to leave the said
Pennewip in undisturbed intercourse with the muses; but we shall have
occasion later to refer to his poetic art, when we shall quote some
poems by his pupils.</p>

<p>After the usual general division into &ldquo;animate&rdquo; and
&ldquo;inanimate&rdquo;&mdash;the good man gave the human <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>race only one
soul&mdash;followed a system that looked like a pyramid. On the top was
God with the angels and spirits and other accessories, while the
oysters and polyps and mussels were crawling about down near the base,
or lying still&mdash;just as they pleased. Half way up stood kings,
members of school-boards, mayors, legislators, theologians and
D.D.&rsquo;s. Next under these were professors and merchants who do not
work themselves. Then came doctors of things profane, <i>i. e.</i>,
those driving double rigs, also lawyers and untitled preachers, the
Colonel of the City Militia, the Rector of the Latin School.
Philosophers (only those who have developed a system), doctors with one
horse, doctors without any horse and poets were further down. Rather
low down, and not far from the mussels, was the seventh sub-division of
the third class of the &ldquo;citizen population.&rdquo; Our hero would
come under this sub-section.</p>

<p>That brings us to Juffrouw Pieterse.</p>

<p>The reader will now have a very good idea of Walter&rsquo;s
environment, and will readily understand why I said he had a
&ldquo;city complexion.&rdquo; That was when we saw him in the
Hartenstraat, on the road to fame, or on the road to that nameless
&ldquo;other thing&rdquo; of Juffrouw Laps. At all events he was on his
way to things that will occupy our attention for some time yet. <span

<h2 class="normal">Chapter VI</h2>

<p>It was Wednesday, and the Pieterses were going to give a party.
Juffrouw Laps had been invited, also the Juffrouw living over the
dairy, whose husband was employed at the &ldquo;bourse.&rdquo; Further
Mrs. Stotter, who had been a midwife for so long and was still merely
&ldquo;very respectable.&rdquo; Then the widow Zipperman, whose
daughter had married some fellow in the insurance business, or
something of the kind. Also the baker&rsquo;s wife. That was
unavoidable: it was impossible to buy all kinds of pastry and cakes
without her finding out what was up. Then the Juffrouw living below and
to the rear. Of course she wouldn&rsquo;t come, but the Pieterses
wanted to show that they had forgotten the late quarrel over the broken
window-pane. If she didn&rsquo;t come that was the end of the matter,
so far as Juffrouw Pieterse was concerned. She would have nothing more
to do with the Juffrouw from below. I may add that the lady from below
did not come, and that her name was stricken from the calling-list of
those higher up.</p>

<p>The children were to go to bed early, with the promise of a cup of
sage-milk for breakfast if they would not make any noise the entire
evening. This drink largely took the place of tea then. It was thought
that the &ldquo;noise&rdquo; made by children would not be appreciated.
Walter got permission to go play <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>with the Halleman boys, who were thought to
be very respectable. He must be at home by eight o&rsquo;clock; but
this was said in a tone that gave him no cause to fear a reprimand in
case he should stay out later. Laurens, who of course was an apprentice
to a printer, and usually came home about seven o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, was big enough to be present with the guests, but must promise
to sit still and drink only two glasses. The big girls were to be
present as a matter of course: They had been confirmed. Stoffel
presided. His business was to meet the gentlemen when they came for the
ladies about ten o&rsquo;clock, and entertain the company with stories
of Mungo Park.</p>

<p>Leentje was to remain till the people were all there, as it was so
inconvenient to have to open the door every time. She could make
herself useful in arranging the table and doing other things incident
to such occasions. But she &ldquo;must move about a little
brisker,&rdquo; otherwise they would prefer to do everything
themselves.</p>

<p>The eldest of the girls, Juffrouw Truitje, must look after the
&ldquo;sage-milk.&rdquo; Pietje had charge of the sandwiches; but
Myntje was to see to it that the butter was spread a little thicker,
for the last time the bread had been too dry.</p>

<p>Everything was going to turn out so nicely, &ldquo;if only Juffrouw
Laps wouldn&rsquo;t talk so much.&rdquo; That was her failing. And,
too, they hoped that the widow Zipperman would &ldquo;brag a little
less about her son-in-law.&rdquo; This was considered a source of
weariness. And the Juffrouw who lived over the dairy &ldquo;might be
more modest.&rdquo; She had &ldquo;never lived in such a fine <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>house&rdquo;;
and as for the shop&mdash;that was no disgrace; and on the top
floor&mdash;but one cannot tell how it will be.</p>

<p>No one understood why the baker&rsquo;s wife used so many French
words, which was not becoming in one of her station. &ldquo;If she does
it this evening, Stoffel, say something to me that she can&rsquo;t
understand, then she will find out that we are not &lsquo;from the
street,&rsquo; that we know what&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same to me,&rdquo; Juffrouw Pieterse
continued, &ldquo;whether the Juffrouw downstairs comes or not. I
don&rsquo;t care a fig about it.&mdash;Four, five&mdash;Louw can sit
there, but he must keep his legs still&mdash;and a chair
there&mdash;yes&mdash;so! It&rsquo;s a good thing she&rsquo;s not
coming; it would have been too crowded. Leentje, go to work&mdash;do
blow your nose! No, run over to Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s and ask the
Juffrouw if the Juffrouw could spare a few stools&mdash;without backs,
you understand; because the chairs there by the chimney&mdash;yes, ask
the Juffrouw for a few stools, and tell the Juffrouw that they are for
me, and that I expect the Juffrouws about seven. Give my compliments to
the Juffrouw and wipe your nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juffrouw Pieterse didn&rsquo;t like to use personal pronouns; it was
impolite.</p>

<p>On this afternoon Walter went to his bridge early. It was now not so
useless as usual, for the rain of the day before had filled the ditch
with water, which was even running, so that the straws which Walter
thoughtlessly, or full of thought&mdash;both are about the same
thing&mdash;threw into the water were carried down to the pond, where
the logs lay that were to be sawed up by the &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;Early Hour.&rdquo; These <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37"
href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>were the names of the sawmills that for some
weeks had been the witnesses of Walter&rsquo;s daydreams.</p>

<p>Glorioso was gone, and could not be replaced; but on those
afternoons when he was free Walter returned involuntarily to the spot
where he had had his first glimpse of the world of romance. How rough
and crude the colors in that first picture! Perhaps it was the very
roughness of the colors that attracted him and changed him, till he
could not conceive how he had ever found enjoyment in the little cakes
on the corner.</p>

<p>A peculiar prospective had opened up before him. He dreamed of
things that he could not name; but they made him bitterly dissatisfied
with his present condition. He was anxious to do everything prescribed
to get to Heaven; but he thought it would be much easier to pray in
such a cave with wax candles. And as for honoring his mother, a point
upon which she always laid great stress&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t she have
a train like the countess? Certainly he ought not to have sold the
Bible; and he wouldn&rsquo;t do it any more&mdash;he had vowed it; but
then he ought to have had a box filled with florins, and a feather in
his cap, just as it was in the book.</p>

<p>He was disgusted with his brother Stoffel, and his sisters, and
Juffrouw Laps, and the preacher and everything. He couldn&rsquo;t
understand why the whole family didn&rsquo;t go to Italy and form a
respectable robber-band. But Pennewip and Keesje shouldn&rsquo;t go;
that was certain.</p>

<p>He wondered what had become of his verses. Every Wednesday such
pupils as had been well-behaved, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38"
href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>and, for that reason, deemed worthy to
contest for the &ldquo;laurel,&rdquo; handed in a poem written on some
subject suggested by the teacher. This time the subject assigned to
Walter was &ldquo;Goodness,&rdquo; which probably had some reference to
his former behavior, and was a hint for the improvement of his moral
character. But Walter had already put goodness into rhyme so often, and
found the subject so dry and tedious and worn-out that he had taken the
liberty of &ldquo;singing&rdquo; something else. He selected the theme
nearest his heart&mdash;robbers!</p>

<p>Like all authors he was greatly infatuated with his work. He was
convinced that the teacher, too, would see the excellencies of his poem
and forgive him for deviating from the path of goodness. The verses
would undoubtedly be sent to the mayor, and he would pass them on to
the Pope, who would then summon Walter and appoint him
&ldquo;Court-robber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus he dreamed and threw his straws into the stream. They moved
away slowly and disappeared between the moss-covered timbers.
Involuntarily his fancy had transmuted them into the characters of his
world of romance. There went the countess with her long train, which
got caught in the moss and held the countess fast. The virtuous Amalia
met with no better luck; she got tangled up in the water lentils. And
now came Walter himself. He approached Amalia, in her green robes, and
was just about to rescue her, when he was swallowed by a duck. This was
most unkind of the duck, for it was Walter&rsquo;s last stalk of grass;
and now in the rattling and buzzing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"
href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>of the sawmills below he could hear Amalia
repeating in a reproachful voice:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Warre, warre, warre, we;</p>

<p class="line">Where is warre, warre, wall&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">Walter, who will rescue me?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This annoyed him, and he could not resist the temptation to throw a
rock at the duck whose greediness had caused Amalia to doubt his
chivalry.</p>

<p>The duck chose the better part, and retired after she had done
Walter all the damage she could. But the sawmills paid no attention to
these happenings and continued to rattle away.</p>

<p>Walter heard now in the noisy clatter of the mills all kinds of
songs and stories, and, listening to these, he soon forgot Amalia and
the Pope. That the reader may not get a wrong impression of these
mills, I hasten to say that there was really nothing extraordinary
about them. They buzzed and rattled just like other sawmills.</p>

<p>It often happens that we think we perceive something which comes
from the external world, when in fact it is only a subjective product
in ourselves. Similarly, we may think we have just imagined something,
when really it came to us from the world of the senses.</p>

<p>This is a kind of ventriloquism that often gives cause for annoyance
and enmity.</p>

<p>I wonder which turns the faster?&mdash;Walter listened to the mills.
Now&mdash;I think&mdash;no, begin together. Good! No, the Eagle was
ahead! Once more&mdash;now!</p>

<p>Which will get there first? No, that won&rsquo;t do. Once more
together. Look sharp, Morning Hour,&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb40" href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>out again! I can&rsquo;t hold my eye
on it&mdash;what a whirling and buzzing!</p>

<p>You are tired, are you? I believe it.</p>

<p>If I might only sit on such a big wing, wouldn&rsquo;t I hold on
tight? And wouldn&rsquo;t the sawyer look?</p>

<p>Why are you called &ldquo;Morning Hour&rdquo;? Have you gold in your
mouth? And &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo;! Can you fly? Take me with you. What a
big play-ground up there, and no school!</p>

<p>I wonder how the first school began. Which came first, the school,
or the teacher? But the first teacher must have attended a school. And
the first school must have had a teacher.</p>

<p>So the first school must have just started itself. But that is
impossible. &ldquo;Eagle,&rdquo; can you turn yourself?&mdash;with the
wind? Can you turn yourself some other way? Try it. Beat &ldquo;Morning
Hour.&rdquo; Quick, quick&mdash;beautiful!</p>

<p>Now, once more alone. Good!</p>

<p>Now, together again! Karre, karre, kra, kra&mdash;stretch your arms
out and take me with you. Will you? Put your hat on, Eagle; how the
ribbons fly.&mdash;Who are you? Warre, warre, ware, wan&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t help it; it was the duck. Tell me what your name is. Fanny,
fanny, fanny, fan&mdash;&mdash; Is your name fan? And you, Morning
Hour, what is your name? Ceny, ceny, ceny, ce. What kind of a name is
Ce? Now together&mdash;sing a song together:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">Fanny, fanny, fanny, fan&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">Ceny, ceny, ceny, ce&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">Fanny, ceny, fanny, ceny,</p>

<p class="line">Fanny, ceny, fan&mdash;cy.</p>
</div>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>
<p>Fancy&mdash;what do you mean by that? Is that the name of both of
you? And what is it? Has it wings?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morning Hour&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eagle&rdquo; had fused into
something that had wings and was called fancy.</p>

<p>Fancy lifted Walter up and bore him away.</p>

<p>When she brought him back to the bridge again it had already been
dark for a long time. He shook himself as if he were wet, rubbed his
eyes and started home. We shall see later what awaited him there; but
first we must go back a few hours. I hope the reader will not disdain
an invitation to Juffrouw Pieterse&rsquo;s. Remember that her husband
never made anything, but bought everything ready-made in Paris.</p>

<p>In passing by I should like to make Master Pennewip a short visit.

<h2 class="normal">Chapter VII</h2>

<p>School was out; and the seats looked as if the pupils had just left
the tediousness of it all lying there. The map of Europe looked down
peevishly on the heap of writing-pads. There lay the mutilated and
well-worn goose-quills, which since time immemorial have opened up the
gates of learning. True, the black-board vaunted itself with the heavy
results of the last lesson in &ldquo;fractions&rdquo;; but the school
was no more. The spirit had fled: It was a corpse.</p>

<p>Yes, the &ldquo;Geist&rdquo; had gone out with the children; for the
reader will see in a moment that they carried about with them a
tremendous amount of that article.</p>

<p>We already know that this was the great day when Pennewip was to
criticise the poetical effusions of his young geniuses. There he sat,
his restless wig sharing all the poetical feelings and
emotions&mdash;and motions&mdash;of its owner. We will just look over
his shoulder and read with him those inestimable treasures of poetic
art; and perhaps we too shall be moved to emotion.</p>

<p>Wig: In the middle, resting quietly.</p>

<p>The wig actually went to the side of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is curious. I hardly know what to say about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wig slipped to the other side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the connection between me and steers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wig protested vigorously against any implication of relationship
with steers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&mdash;mm! Can it be that this is what our new-fangled
writers call humour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wig sank down to his eyebrows, which signified doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will call up the boy and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>
<p>The wig fairly leaped with pleasure, and the curls embraced one
another. This out-pouring of Trudie&rsquo;s heart was borne at once to
Juffrouw Pennewip, and was later hung by the fireplace in honor of the
poetess and the subject of the poem.</p>

<p>Then followed a sublime poem on God by Klaasje van der Gracht, the
son of the Catechist. He was thirteen years old, and had not been
vaccinated&mdash;out of regard for predestination.</p>

<p>The wig seemed dissatisfied. The &ldquo;Religion&rdquo; of Lucas de

<p>The wig was moving continually. It looked as if it were fishing
too.</p>

<p>The teacher looked hurriedly through the remaining <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>poems and picked out
the offspring of the entire Wilde connection. His worst suspicions were
realized. Mietje de Wilde, Kees de Wilde, Piet and Jan de
Wilde&mdash;all uniformly declared that religion, friendship, fishing,
dreaming, cauliflower and deception &ldquo;very nice must be,&rdquo;
and that they were also very pleasing &ldquo;to the people we
see.&rdquo; A regular flood of the nice and pleasing.</p>

<p>Now, what do you suppose the wig did? It did the best thing that
could be done under the circumstances. More could not be expected of a
wig. As soon as it saw the futility of its efforts to comprehend the
difference between fishing, friendship, deception, dreams, religion and
cauliflower, it merely ignored the whole matter, readjusted itself and
assumed an expression of expectancy for what was yet to come.</p>

lines on goodness.</p>

<p>Then he saw that on Walter&rsquo;s sheet there was not a trace of
&ldquo;goodness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, wretched wig!</p>

<p>Yes, wretched wig! For after it had suffered as never wig had
suffered before, after it had been pulled at and tugged at and martyred
in a manner beyond even the imagination of the Wilde family, Master
Pennewip snatched it from his head, twisted it convulsively in his
hands, stammered a short
&ldquo;Heaven-human-Christian-soul-good-gracious-my-life&mdash;how is
it possible!&rdquo; slapped it on his head again, covered it with his
venerable cap and burst out the door like one possessed.</p>

<p>He was on his way to Walter&rsquo;s home, where we shall soon see
him arrive. As a conscientious historian, however, it will be my duty

<h2 class="normal">Chapter VIII</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness, I&rsquo;m glad to see you! And so early, too!
Leetje, place a chair over there and get the footstool, but be in a
hurry, or I&rsquo;d rather do it myself. And how are you? Juffrouw Laps
is coming too, you know&mdash;Myntje, you&rsquo;d better be thinking of
your dough and stop combing your head. That girl can&rsquo;t keep her
hands off of her hair when there&rsquo;s company. But do take a
seat&mdash;no, not in the corner; there&rsquo;s a draft
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no more draft in this corner than is usual to corners; but
Mrs. Stotter was only a Vrouw, and not a &ldquo;Juffrouw.&rdquo; She
had no right to the seat of honour; for on all occasions a Juffrouw
takes precedence of a Vrouw, just as a Mevrouw takes precedence of a
Juffrouw. Everyone must keep his place, especially those in III, 7, b1;
or c., where etiquette is observed more closely than at the court of
Madrid. The care and anxiety of the mistress of ceremonies make her
work most trying, and, too, not merely for Juffrouw Pieterse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear Juffrouw Pieterse, I was so surprised when Louwie
came to invite me, for I had just remarked to Wimpje, who makes caps,
you know&mdash;no, thank you, Pietje, I don&rsquo;t care for any just
now&mdash;I said to Wimpje, I wonder what Juffrouw Pieterse is doing,
for I hadn&rsquo;t heard from you in so long, you know&mdash;yes, just
throw it aside, it&rsquo;s my old one; I <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb49" href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>knew you wouldn&rsquo;t mind my
wearing my old one&mdash;and then Wimpje said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>What Wimpje really said I don&rsquo;t know. Mrs. Stotter&rsquo;s
garment, which she had described as her &ldquo;old one,&rdquo; was
removed and placed on the foot of the bed in the back room. The
children, who were piled together there like sardines, were duly
admonished not to stretch out their feet, lest in doing so they injure
Mrs. Stotter&rsquo;s &ldquo;old&rdquo; garment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, my dear, be seated&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s for us,
twice already. Leentje, where are you hiding now? Can&rsquo;t you hear
that somebody is ringing?&mdash;It&rsquo;s probably Juffrouw Zipperman.
Juffrouw Zipperman is coming, too, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again I am at a loss: I don&rsquo;t know whether it was Juffrouw
Zipperman who had rung, or somebody else. But the reader need not scold
me for writing a story that I don&rsquo;t know myself. I cannot be sure
whether it was Juffrouw Zipperman this time or Juffrouw Mabbel, from
the bakery, or Juffrouw Krummel, whose husband is at the bourse, or
Juffrouw Laps&mdash;but she didn&rsquo;t need to ring, as she lived in
the house. Anyway, by half past seven the entire company was assembled,
and Stoffel was smoking his pipe as if his life depended upon it.
Leentje had gone home without her piece of bread and butter. She
&ldquo;could get it to-morrow&rdquo;; to-day there was &ldquo;so much
to do,&rdquo; and &ldquo;one can&rsquo;t do everything at once, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then she got another one right away&mdash;don&rsquo;t you
know? One with a wart on her nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s an ordeal one has with girls,&rdquo; said
Juffrouw Pieterse. &ldquo;Take another piece, don&rsquo;t wait <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>to be insisted
upon; it&rsquo;s a cake from your own dough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Excusez</span>,&rdquo; said the Juffrouw from
the bakery, with a mouth like a rabbit, a style of mouth signifying
graciousness and good breeding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must eat more, or I shall think you don&rsquo;t like
it.&rdquo; She had baked it herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I cannot refuse, Juffrouw Pieterse. Oblig&eacute; and
many thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Juffrouw Laps, what can I pass you?&rdquo; Juffrouw
Laps selected ginger cake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fill the cups, Trudie! Yes, Mrs. Stotter, when you are here
you must drink with us. You are welcome to anything we&rsquo;ve got.
Pietje, wipe off a table&mdash;such a girl! And now go and look after
the baby, and tell her that I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more noise.
Ah, Juffrouw Mabbel, children are a great deal of trouble. And your
little Sientje&mdash;how is her cough now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a magnetisier, but that isn&rsquo;t enough.
We must have the clairvoyange of the sonnebule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! One can hardly believe it. And when
is he coming, the cler&mdash;cleek&mdash;clar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the nerves, Juffrouw Zipperman. But he has the
little nightcap and nightgown, in which she has sweated, you know; and
he says that it will come all right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who would have thought it! What will you do now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it; the sonnebule must tell us what to
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps could not agree to this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do it&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t do it&mdash;not
for anything <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href=
"#pb51">51</a>]</span>in the world! I tell you, what God does is all
right. Just mark my words!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Juffrouw Laps; but the Juffrouw at the provision store
did it, and her child is lots better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what <i>you</i> say, Juffrouw Mabbel, but I tell
you there is something in her eye that I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then, Juffrouw Laps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has a look, a look&mdash;and it&rsquo;s sin&mdash;I tell
you it is. It&rsquo;s wrong, it won&rsquo;t do. What God does is all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Stoffel, talk some. You sit there like a stone. Recite
a poem, or tell us something about your school. Would you believe it,
Juffrouw Mabbel, he knows a whole poem by heart. And he has memorized
all the verbs of the feminine gender.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, what are you talking about?&rdquo; said Stoffel,
displeased. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m smoking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I meant when you were through smoking. Then you
can repeat the words. You will be surprised, Juffrouw Zipperman, and
wonder where he learned it all. How does it go? &lsquo;I would have
been drunk, he would have been drunk&rsquo;&mdash;of course, you know,
he was not drunk, it belongs with the verbs. You will kill yourself
laughing when he begins. Fill the cups, Trudie, and blow in the spout;
there&rsquo;s a leaf over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reader will not take it amiss, I trust, if I pass over the
subsequent history of this leaf, and, too, make some deviations from
the text of the conversation during the further course of Juffrouw
Pieterse&rsquo;s tea-evening. Stoffel spun off his conjugations and the
ladies fairly shrieked when he related how &ldquo;he had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>been drunk&rdquo;
and that &ldquo;he would be drunk.&rdquo; Thereupon followed general
and particular criticism of the neighbors. The Juffrouw below received
her share, as a matter of course: She was absent.</p>

<p>Religion and faith play an important part. Juffrouw Laps was for
organizing a prayer-class. The preachers of to-day, she insisted, take
their work too lightly and don&rsquo;t sweep out all the corners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, it&rsquo;s in the Bible that man is only
man,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I want to tell you. Man
must not try to know better than God himself. Salvation comes through
grace, and grace through faith; but if a man is not chosen, then he has
no grace and can have no faith. That&rsquo;s the way he is damned,
don&rsquo;t you see? I tell you, it&rsquo;s just as certain as twice
two&mdash;understand? And for that reason I want to have a
prayer-class. Not for the sake of money or profit&mdash;God help me,
no! At most just a trifle for the fair, or for New Year. What do you
think of the plan, Juffrouw Mabbel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That lady expressed the opinion that her husband would be opposed to
it, for he liked to go out of evenings, and then she must stay in the
shop. Besides, it was so difficult to get through with the work. No one
could imagine what a laborious occupation baking was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Juffrouw Zipperman? Don&rsquo;t you think it
would be a go? I would serve coffee; and the people could leave
something on the saucers. Really, I am not doing it for the money. We
would begin with the Old Testament&mdash;and then&mdash;exercise, you
know; practice&mdash;understand?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb53" href="#pb53">53</a>]</span></p>

<p>Juffrouw Zipperman thought it would be very nice; but her son-in-law
had said that the preachers are paid to do this, and that any
additional &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; was merely an unnecessary
expense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say to it, Juffrouw Krummel? Don&rsquo;t you
think that such a class&mdash;just a small
class&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juffrouw Krummel said she practiced with her husband when he came
from the bourse.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps was now forced to turn to Mrs. Stotter, though she
felt that she was letting herself down in appealing to a Vrouw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear Juffrouw Laps, if you had been a midwife as long
as I have you&rsquo;d take no interest in a prayer-class. Now there is
M&rsquo;neer Littelman in Prince Street. I&rsquo;ve been at his
house&mdash;always in respectable houses&mdash;and he always
said&mdash;it&rsquo;s a house with high steps, and in the hall
there&rsquo;s a big clock about the wind and rain&mdash;and he always
said: &lsquo;Vrouw Stotter,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a good
woman,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and a faithful midwife. I always tell the
people that,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;all of
my connection must send for you,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;when people tell you this you must act as if you
didn&rsquo;t hear it&rsquo;&mdash;thank you, Juffrouw Pieterse, my cup
is turned over. Just as I said: Everyone must know what he&rsquo;s
doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But just a little exercise like that, Mrs.
Stotter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible, it&rsquo;s possible. But I&rsquo;ve had
so much experience in such things. I go my own way; and that&rsquo;s
the best way, too. For I&rsquo;ve been in the home of M&rsquo;neer
Witte, who has an uncle in congress&mdash;for I always go to
respectable places&mdash;and he always said, because he&rsquo;s so
funny: &lsquo;Child-woman, child-woman, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb54" href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>you&rsquo;re nothing but a
child-woman.&rsquo; I was just going to say that I know what I&rsquo;m
doing, for I&rsquo;ve seen a lot in my life. There&rsquo;s
M&rsquo;neer&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name? There in Prince
Street&mdash;no, no<span class="corr" id="xd0e1431" title="Not in
source">,</span> Market Square. Oh, what is his name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reader will have noticed that Mrs. Stotter digressed from the
theme. But other folk do the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Juffrouw Pieterse, what do you think of the idea? Just a
little exercise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear, I have exercise enough with my children. You
don&rsquo;t know what it means to bring up nine. I always worship with
the children, for the Bible says&mdash;Trudie, go to the baby; I hear
her again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something noble in Trudie&rsquo;s gait as she walked into
that back room. One could see that she felt flattered by the
transmission to her of maternal dignity. Little Kee, the baby, was less
flattered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were we talking about? Yes, that is my religious
service. The children keep me busy. You don&rsquo;t know anything about
it; if I bring them up properly&mdash;run, Pietje, and straighten out
Simon. He&rsquo;s pinching his sister again; he always does it when
there&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simon was straightened out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whenever we have company the children behave so badly. There
it goes again. Myntje, go and see what&rsquo;s the matter and tell them
to go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Myntje went, returning immediately with the report that they had
&ldquo;turned something over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>General indignation. Angry message from the Juffrouw below. It was
unpleasant for the Juffrouw below when the children of the Juffrouw
above turned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href=
"#pb55">55</a>]</span>over things and flooded the back room. Terrible
excitement.</p>

<p>Finally the children were straightened out.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Zipperman again sat in the corner where there was such a
&ldquo;draft.&rdquo; This only goes to show that earthly greatness has
its dark side, and that a son-in-law in the insurance business entitles
one to rheumatism.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps was greatly pleased with the hearty manner in which
punishment was meted out to the children. It was exactly according to
Scripture, she said; and then she cited a text or two in which the rod
was prescribed. It&rsquo;s in the Bible somewhere, I don&rsquo;t know
where. The Bible mentions everything, and the &ldquo;rod&rdquo;
especially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Stoffel,&rdquo; said the hostess sweetly, &ldquo;recite
something for us.&rdquo; She wanted to show that her children could do
something else besides pinch and turn things over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything,&rdquo; said Stoffel, but without
a trace of Socratic arrogance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just say for us what you said the other day. Come, Stoffel.
That&rsquo;s the way he always is, Juffrouw Mabbel. One has to pull him
up on his feet before he will do anything. But then he goes all right.
Forward, Stoffel! He&rsquo;s tired now. Teaching in such a school is
hard work. Yes, Juffrouw, he&rsquo;s as smart as he can be. Would you
believe it? All words are either masculine or feminine. Aren&rsquo;t
they, Stoffel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No? But&mdash;and the other day you said&mdash;it&rsquo;s
only to get him started, you know, Juffrouw Zipperman<span class="corr"
id="xd0e1470" title="Source: .">,</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb56" href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>it takes a little time, because
he&rsquo;s worn out with his school work&mdash;but you said that all
words&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother. Masculine, feminine or neuter, I said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and still more,&rdquo; said Juffrouw Pieterse.
&ldquo;You will be astonished when you hear him. What do you suppose
you are, Juffrouw Krummel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? What I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, what you are&mdash;what you really are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Juffrouw Krummel,&rdquo; she said, but doubtfully; for
she read in the triumphant look of Juffrouw Pieterse and the tightly
closed lips of Stoffel that she might easily be something entirely
different from Juffrouw Krummel.</p>

<p>The tension did not need to be farther increased; so Juffrouw
Pieterse passed now from the special to the general. Her glance took in
the entire company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, too, Juffrouw Mabbel; and you, Juffrouw Laps; and
you, Juffrouw Zipperman; and you, Mrs. Stotter&mdash;what do you all
think you are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one knew.</p>

<p>This will not be surprising to anyone who knows how difficult
knowledge of the &ldquo;self&rdquo; is; but Stoffel had something else
in mind. There was a deeper meaning involved.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps was the first to answer, and she spoke with proud
self-sufficiency:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Juffrouw Laps!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wrong, wrong&mdash;entirely wrong!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But for Heaven sake, am I not Juffrouw Laps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s. Of course you are Juffrouw Laps; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>Stoffel didn&rsquo;t
ask who you were, but what you were. There&rsquo;s the fine
point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I am? I&rsquo;m Dutch Reform!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s. That you are, too; but&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t that. The
question is, What <i>are</i> you? Help her out, Stoffel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Between puffs of smoke, and with the air of a professor, Stoffel
proceeded to &ldquo;help&rdquo;:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juffrouw Laps, I wished to know what you were from a
zo&ouml;logical standpoint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have anything more to do with it,&rdquo; said
Juffrouw Laps in the tone of one who feels that he is going to be
insulted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a midwife,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stotter, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m going to stick to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am the baker&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; cried Juffrouw
Mabbel, with a positiveness in her tone which showed her intention to
hold to this opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly, Juffrouw Mabbel; but I mean from a
zo&ouml;logical standpoint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s going to be indecent, I prefer to go
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; added Juffrouwen Krummel and Zipperman.
&ldquo;We came here to be entertained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not going to get angry about it! I tell you,
it&rsquo;s in the book, Stoffel&mdash;you will laugh when you hear it,
Juffrouw Mabbel; and the best part of it is, that it&rsquo;s in the
book, and one can&rsquo;t say anything against it. Tell her,
Stoffel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juffrouw Laps,&rdquo; said Stoffel with dignity&mdash;an
important moment in Juffrouw Pieterse&rsquo;s tea-evening had
arrived&mdash;&ldquo;Juffrouw Laps, you are a <i>sucking
animal</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I admit frankly that I cannot adequately describe <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>the crisis that
followed these two words. If Stoffel had only said mammal, perhaps then
my task would have been easier.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s face took on all the different colors that are
generally supposed to express anger. She had been attacked more openly
than the others, it is true; but her attitude toward the prayer-class
would go to show that she was naturally polemical.</p>

<p>In French novels people used to turn green; but Juffrouw Laps did
not read French, so she stopped at a terrible violet and
screamed&mdash;no, she didn&rsquo;t. She didn&rsquo;t scream anything;
for she was choking for breath. But she did pulverize that piece of
ginger cake; and she looked at Stoffel and his mother in a manner that
would have been most damaging for her if those two persons had happened
to die that night.</p>

<p>Imitating the trick of the cuttle-fish, no doubt unconsciously,
Stoffel managed to escape this fatal stare by enveloping himself in a
heavy cloud of smoke. Juffrouw Pieterse, however, not being a smoker,
was at the mercy of Juffrouw Laps. She stammered humbly:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the book, really it&rsquo;s in the book.
Don&rsquo;t be angry, it&rsquo;s in the book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Juffrouw Laps was getting a little air, so much that
there was now no danger of her suffocating. She threw the mutilated
remains of the ginger cake on the table and began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juffrouw Pieterse, you are nothing but a low, vile,
filthy&mdash;you may even be a sucking animal, you and your son too. I
want you to understand that I&rsquo;ve always been respectable. My
father sold grain, and nobody&rsquo;s ever been able to say anything
against me! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=
"#pb59">59</a>]</span>Ask everybody about me&mdash;if I&rsquo;ve ever
run with men-folk, and such things; and if I haven&rsquo;t always paid
my debts. He was manager I would have you understand, and we lived over
the chapter-house, for he was in the grain business, and you can ask
about me there. Thank God, you can ask about me everywhere&mdash;do you
hear? But never, never, never, has such a thing happened to me. What
you put on me! If it wasn&rsquo;t for lowering myself I&rsquo;d tell
you what I think of you&mdash;you sucking animal, you and your son and
your whole family. My father sold grain, and I&rsquo;m too <span class=
"corr" id="xd0e1551" title="Source: resectable">respectable</span> for
you to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;it&rsquo;s in the book that way. For God&rsquo;s
sake believe me; it&rsquo;s in the book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just hold your lip about your book. Anybody who sells
God&rsquo;s holy word on the Ouwebrug needn&rsquo;t talk to me about
books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This accusation was false; for Walter, and not his mother, had sold
the Bible; but this was no time for such fine distinctions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stoffel, go get the book and show Juffrouw&mdash;my God, what
shall I do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to the Devil with your book and your sucking animals.
You&rsquo;ve got nothing to show in your book. I know you&mdash;and
your lout of a son, and your wenches of daughters, that are growing up
like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Truitje, Myntje and Pietje, understanding from this that there was
something radically wrong with their growth, began to screech too.
Other members of the party bawled a word from time to time, as
opportunity presented itself. Then came another message from the
Juffrouw below. This time she threatened to <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb60" href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>call in the police. The children,
taking advantage of the general excitement to break the ban under which
they had been placed, had left the bed and were now listening at the
keyhole. Juffrouw Pieterse was calling for the camphor bottle,
declaring that she was going to die; Mrs. Stotter was clamoring for her
wrap&mdash;her &ldquo;old one&rdquo;; and Stoffel was playing
cuttle-fish as well as he could.</p>

<p>All had got up and were going to leave. They could &ldquo;put up
with a good deal,&rdquo; but that was &ldquo;too much&rdquo;! Juffrouw
Krummel was going to tell her husband; Juffrouw Zipperman was going to
let everybody in the insurance business know about it; Mrs. Stotter was
going to relate the whole story to the gentleman in Prince Street; and
Juffrouw Mabbel&mdash;I forget whom she was going to tell it all to. In
short, every one of them was going to see to it that the affair was
well aired.</p>

<p>Who knows but what these threats would have been carried out, if the
good genius of the Pieterses had not at that moment caused someone to
ring the door-bell? It was that worthy gentleman whom we left in such a
state of pious despair at the close of the last chapter. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
</div>

<div id="ch9" class="div1"><span class="pagenum"> [<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>

<h2 class="normal">Chapter IX</h2>

<p>Yes, the door-bell rang. And it rang again: So it was &ldquo;for
us.&rdquo; Juffrouw Pieterse drew a long breath; and I must say, she
did a very proper thing. While admitting that it is foolish to say what
one would do if one were somebody else, still, in her place I should
have drawn a long breath, too. Firstly, because I imagine she
hadn&rsquo;t done this for a long time; secondly, because I know how,
in adverse circumstances, every change and interruption gives one
ground for hope; and, finally, because I think Juffrouw Pieterse was
human, just like the rest of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dears,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;be peaceable. It must
be the gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies declared it couldn&rsquo;t be the gentlemen, because it
was too early for them; and this very doubt and uncertainty as to who
it might be gave the crisis a favorable turn.</p>

<p>Mere uncertainty, even when in no way connected with what is
occupying us, has a sort of paralyzing effect. Besides, when one is
interrupted in one&rsquo;s anger, afterwards it is difficult to find
the place where one left off.</p>

<p>This was Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s experience; she tried it, but it
wouldn&rsquo;t work. Her &ldquo;a sucking animal, a sucking
animal!&rdquo; was smothered by, &ldquo;What can it mean? He never
comes before ten!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href=
"#pb62">62</a>]</span></p>

<p>Juffrouw Pieterse quickly availed herself of this diversion to get
them all seated again.</p>

<p>Trudie was commissioned to &ldquo;straighten out&rdquo; the
children, who came off rather badly. The hostess was just about to
state a new zo&ouml;logical argument, which should establish peace
between the hostile parties, when the door opened and Master Pennewip
stood before the agitated assembly.</p>

<p>He, too, was agitated: the reader knows it.</p>

<p>The surprise caused by the arrival of this unexpected visitor had a
most favorable effect on the peace negotiations. A truce was tacitly
declared, though not without the proviso, at least on Juffrouw
Laps&rsquo;s part, that hostilities should be reopened as soon as
curiosity as to Pennewip&rsquo;s visit had been sufficiently satisfied.
Indeed, she was all the more willing for a truce, as it was evident
from the man&rsquo;s appearance that there was something momentous at
hand. His wig cried out fire and murder in unmistakable tones. And that
was just what the good Juffrouw Laps liked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Juffrouw Pieterse; my humblest respects. I see
you have company, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t make a bit of difference,&rsquo;
Master Pennewip.&lsquo;Come right in and take a seat.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>These forms of expression were rigidly observed in the
&ldquo;citizen populace,&rdquo; III, 7. c.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you drink a cup with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juffrouw Pieterse,&rdquo; he said with extreme dignity,
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here simply to drink a cup of
sage-milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Master Pennewip, please be seated!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63">63</a>]</span></p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t easy; but the ladies made room and he was soon
seated.</p>

<p>He cleared up his throat and looked about him with dignity. Then he
drew a roll of manuscript from his pocket, disarranged his wig and
spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juffrouw Pieterse! You are a worthy, respectable woman, and
your husband sold shoes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juffrouw Pieterse looked triumphantly at Juffrouw Laps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Master Pennewip, quite so; he
did&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <span class="corr" id="xd0e1620" title="Source:
interupt">interrupt</span> me, Juffrouw Pieterse. Your departed husband
sold shoes. I have taught your children from little tots up to their
confirmation. Haven&rsquo;t I, Juffrouw Pieterse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Master Pennewip,&rdquo; she replied modestly; for she
was afraid of that excessive dignity in Pennewip&rsquo;s manner and
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I just want to ask you, Juffrouw Pieterse, whether,
during all this time that your children were in my school, you ever
heard any complaints&mdash;reasonable complaints&mdash;of the manner in
which I, with my wife, instructed your children in reading, writing,
arithmetic, national history, psalmody, sewing, knitting, drawing and
religion? I put the question to you, Juffrouw Pieterse, and wait for a
reply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An awful silence followed this speech. The Juffrouw below had every
reason to be satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Master Pennewip&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any &lsquo;but&rsquo;, Juffrouw Pieterse.
I ask you, whether you have had any complaints. I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>mean, of course,
well grounded complaints about my instruction in reading, writing,
arithmetic&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no, Master Pennewip, I have no complaints;
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So-oo? No complaints? Well, then I will explain to
you&mdash;where is your son Walter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walter? Dear me! Hasn&rsquo;t he come home, Trudie? He went
to take a walk with the Halleman boys. They are such respectable
children, Master Pennewip, and they live&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So! With the Hallemans&mdash;who go to the French school!
Aha, and that&rsquo;s it? So&mdash;from the Hallemans! And he learns
such things from the Hallemans&mdash;the Hallemans <i>III, 7,
a<sup>2</sup></i>, perhaps &lsquo;<i>a</i>&rsquo;&mdash;yes, who knows
but that it might be <i>II</i>. It&rsquo;s no wonder&mdash;immorality,
viciousness&mdash;at the French school! And now, Juffrouw Pieterse, I
want to tell you that your son&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Pennewip looked about him as if he were drinking in the
breathless silence that had fallen over his hearers.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps hastened to repay with compound interest that
triumphant look of the hostess, while that lady, thoroughly miserable,
was making frequent use of the camphor bottle. She was not so much
mortified that Juffrouw Laps should hear something else unfavorable
about Walter, who had caused them so much trouble, as angry that she
should be the witness of an accusation that would give her a new weapon
in the zo&ouml;logical fray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so? Nothing good will ever <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>come to this
Walter. A boy that begins with the Bible will end with something else.
Yes, Master Pennewip, I&rsquo;m not surprised&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised at anything he did. I&rsquo;ve seen it coming for a long
time. But what shouldn&rsquo;t one expect from a
family&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As quick as a flash Juffrouw Pieterse saw here her opportunity to
recover her lost advantage. Stoffel had said it was in the book; but a
teacher must know whatever is in a book. Therefore&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Pennewip,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Is it true that
Juffrouw Laps is a sucking animal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am convinced that Pennewip brought this question under a special
category for &ldquo;peculiar overflowings of the heart,&rdquo; seeing
that it followed upon his unfinished accusation against Walter. He
looked over his glasses and slowly described with his eye a circle,
peopled with women holding their breath, heads and necks stretched out
and mouths wide open. The attitude of Juffrouw Laps was threatening
above everything else, and said quite distinctly: Answer or die! Am I a
sucking animal?</p>

<p>&ldquo;With whom have I the honor to speak?&rdquo; he asked,
probably not considering that this question made the matter still more
mysterious, giving the impression that Laps&rsquo;s animal quality
depended upon her name, age, place of residence, family relations,
etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Juffrouw Laps,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and live down
stairs in the front part of the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;so! Yes, indeed you belong to the class of sucking
animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A ten-fold sigh was heaved; and Juffrouw Pieterse was again
triumphant. In politics and the citizen <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb66" href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>populace complete equilibrium is
impossible. The parties or powers are in continual motion, first one in
the ascendency, then the other.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps, who had not been able to accomplish anything with
pride, now attempted good humor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Master Pennewip,&rdquo; she said sweetly, &ldquo;how can
you say such a thing? My father was in the grain business
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juffrouw Laps, answer me one question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Master Pennewip, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer me, Juffrouw Laps, where do you live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where I live? Why, in my room, down stairs&mdash;two
windows&mdash;front entrance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You miss the significance of my question entirely, Juffrouw
Laps. The meaning would be similar if I were to ask you if you belonged
to that class of organisms that live in oyster-shells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Juffrouw Laps,&rdquo; cried the triumphant hostess,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the point&mdash;the main point!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Stoffel added that it was really and truly the main point.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps saw that she was hopelessly lost, for she had to admit
to herself that she didn&rsquo;t usually reside in an oyster-shell. She
looked at the teacher with astonishment; but he paid no attention at
all to the effect of his questions. Assuming a sort of legal
manner&mdash;which was closely imitated by his wig, he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you live in water? Have you gills?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In water? But&mdash;Master Pennewip&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wig to the left, which meant: No, but! <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb67" href="#pb67">67</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Or half in water, half on land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Pennewip, how should I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wig to the right: No subterfuges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer me, Juffrouw Laps, have you cold blood? Do you bring
living young into the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a sin, Master Pennewip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wig now looked like a battering-ram, anticipating the nature of
the next question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you lay eggs, Juffrouw Laps? I only ask you the question.
Can you lay eggs? Eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said she couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are a sucking animal, Juffrouw Laps!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wig was in the middle again resting quietly. It had vanquished
Juffrouw Laps.</p>

<p>I wonder what the reader&rsquo;s idea is of the effect produced on
the company by this terrible sentence, against which there could be no
appeal. There was something pitiless in Pennewip&rsquo;s manner, and in
his contracted eyebrows there was no intimation of mercy. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
</div>

<div id="ch10" class="div1"><span class="pagenum"> [<a href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter X</h2>

<p>The attentive reader who knows human nature will naturally wish to
know why I closed the last chapter so tamely, and why that
zo&ouml;logical problem which, only a short time before had caused such
a violent explosion, was now allowed to rest in peace.</p>

<p>There are three reasons for this.</p>

<p>Firstly, the women had been so wrought up that they were now
exhausted.</p>

<p>Secondly, Juffrouw Laps, the shrewd leader of the fight, looked over
the battlefield and, without thinking of the famous battle between the
Horatii and the Curiatii, saw with innate tactical talent the
correctness of &ldquo;divide and conquer.&rdquo; With the forces
Stotter, Mabbel, Krummel and Zipperman against the house of
Pieterse&mdash;that was all right. But now that the house was supported
by Pennewip&rsquo;s powerful hand, it was prudent to withdraw from the
battle. For who could guarantee her that she might depend upon her
allies? What assurance had she that the midwife, or even Juffrouw
Zipperman would not go over to the enemy?&mdash;if only out of
deference to the versatile wig! No, no, no! She wouldn&rsquo;t risk her
rhetorical artillery in such a doubtful engagement! She was content to
say to herself, &ldquo;I will get even with you later.&rdquo; Imagining
her, with all her relations to society, multiplied <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>by twenty or thirty
millions, we would have read the next day in this or that official Laps
organ something like this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our relations with the Pietersian empire are most cordial.
The recent friendly meeting between the two sovereigns was merely that
they might have the mutual pleasure of seeing one another, and had no
political significance whatever. It will be seen how unfounded were
those rumors of &lsquo;strained relations,&rsquo; which were said to
have been brought about by a discussion of certain characteristics of
our popular princess. The reader will recall that we never gave
credence to those rumors, and reported them with great
reserve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thirdly. The third and chief cause of the armistice
was&mdash;curiosity. Under the present changed circumstances whoever
betrayed any anger would have to leave; and whoever left would not find
out why Master Pennewip had come, or what new crime Walter had
committed. Again we see the truth of the proposition, that everything
has its good side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Master Pennewip,&rdquo; asked Juffrouw
Pieterse&mdash;she threw the subdued sucking animal a look that was
like a triumphant telegram, and read: Where are you
now?&mdash;&ldquo;but Master Pennewip, what has Walter been doing
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what has he been up to this time,&rdquo; added Juffrouw
Laps, delighted that the conversation had taken this turn, and that she
was now to hear about Walter&rsquo;s latest sin.</p>

<p>For the sinner is a thing in which pious persons find much
edification. As we have already seen, Juffrouw Laps was fond of
edification. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href=
"#pb70">70</a>]</span></p>

<p>Pennewip was just on the point of beginning his indictment when the
door-bell rang. It rang again: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for
us&rdquo;&mdash;and in a moment our truant walked into the room.</p>

<p>He was paler than usual, and with good reason; for strange things
had happened to him since Fancy had lifted him up and borne him
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juffrouw Pieterse,&rdquo; began Pennewip, &ldquo;my school is
famous, even as far away as Kattenburg. Do you hear me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Master Pennewip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I repeat it: Famous! And, too, chiefly on account of the fine
moral there&mdash;I mean, of course, in my school. Religion and
morality occupy the first place in my school. I could show you verses
on the Deity&mdash;but I pass over that. It is sufficient for you to
know that my school is famous as far as&mdash;but what am I talking
about&mdash;I&rsquo;ve even had a boy from Wittenburg; and I was once
consulted about the education of a boy whose father lived at
Muiderberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Master Pennewip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Juffrouw, I still have the letter and could show it to
you. The man was a gravedigger&mdash;the boy painted inappropriate
figures on the coffins. And just for this reason I feel it my duty to
tell you that I don&rsquo;t intend to see my school lose its good name
through that good-for-nothing boy of yours there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Walter had fallen from the clouds. That sounded quite different
from a papal appointment&mdash;which he really no longer cared for, as
he had just received another appointment that pleased him better.</p>

<p>His mother wanted to pass immediately to what she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>called her
&ldquo;divine worship&rdquo; and give him a sound thrashing, in order
to satisfy the teacher that religion and morality took the first place
in her house, too.</p>

<p>But the teacher found it preferable to tell the party what the
trouble was, and incidentally to strengthen the feeling of guilt in the
patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your son belongs to the class of robbers, murderers,
ravishers of women, incendiaries&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holy grace! Heavenly righteousness! Compassionate Christian
souls! Ah, divine and human virtue, is it possible! What must we
endure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I cannot always be exact; but, in general, such was the flood of
exclamations that all but swept away that ten-year-old robber,
murderer, ravisher of women and incendiary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to read you something from his hand,&rdquo; said
the teacher, &ldquo;and then if anybody still doubts the boy&rsquo;s
viciousness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>All tacitly promised to have no doubts.</p>

<p>The work that the teacher read was indeed of such a nature as to
leave small room for doubts; and I, who have chosen Walter for my hero,
anticipate difficulty in convincing the reader that he was not so bad
as he seemed&mdash;after his</p>

out.</p>

<p>But Walter&rsquo;s was not a nature to be easily disturbed. After
his mother had beaten him till she came to her senses again, he went to
bed in the little back room, far from dissatisfied with the day&rsquo;s
work, and was soon dreaming of Fancy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XI</h2>

<p>On the next day things had largely resumed their wonted course. That
someone may not charge me with carelessness, or indifference towards
the persons with whom we spent a pleasant evening, I will remark in
passing that Juffrouw Mabbel was again busy with her baking and
&ldquo;clairvoyange,&rdquo; and that Mrs. Stotter had resumed her
activities with the stork. Those unfortunate creatures who were
committed to her care she condemned to lie motionless for two or three
months&mdash;perhaps to give the newly born an idea of their new
career, and, at the same time, to punish them for the shameful uproar
they had caused by their birth.</p>

<p>As for Master Pennewip, he was busy, as usual, educating future
grandparents of the past. His wig had not yet recovered from the
excitement of the night before and was longing for Sunday.</p>

<p>Klaasje van der Gracht had been awarded the prize with an
impressive, &ldquo;Keep on that way, my boy&rdquo;; and he kept on. I
still see poems in the papers whose clearness, conciseness and
sublimity betray his master hand. I have heard that he died of
smallpox&mdash;he had not been vaccinated; it will be
remembered&mdash;but I consider it my duty to protect him from any such
slander. A genius does not die; otherwise it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth
while to be born a genius. Still, if Klaas <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb76" href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>had died like other people, his
spirit would have lived in those coming after him. And that is a
beautiful immortality.</p>

<p>The family de Wilde, too, has not died out, and will not die. I am
certain of it.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Krummel asked her husband if she was really a
&ldquo;sucking animal.&rdquo; Being from the bourse, and having much
worldly wisdom, he replied after reflection that of such things he
didn&rsquo;t believe more than half he heard. &ldquo;In this case the
last half,&rdquo; he added&mdash;but softly.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Zipperman had caught a cold; but was still able to boast
about her son-in-law. She was a &ldquo;respectable woman.&rdquo; Only
she couldn&rsquo;t endure for Juffrouw Laps to talk so much about
&ldquo;virtue,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;respectability&rdquo; of her
father, who was &ldquo;in the grain business.&rdquo; Old Man Laps, she
said, was not <i>in</i>, but <i>under</i> the grain business. He had
carried sacks of grain, but that was quite different from selling
grain. For the man who sells is much bigger than the man who carries.
Juffrouw, therefore, had been making misleading statements.</p>

<p>Trudie and her sisters had decked themselves out as well as possible
and were sitting at the window. When young people passed by they looked
as if they had never in their lives straightened out anybody.</p>

<p>The Juffrouw in the rear below told the grocer that she was going to
move out; for it was just scandalous, simply scandalous the way the
Pieterses carried on in their back room; that she couldn&rsquo;t leave
anything uncovered.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Pieterse was busy with her household, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>and looked like a
working woman. From time to time she had &ldquo;divine service&rdquo;
with the children, who, if they could have had their choice, would have
preferred to have been born among the Alfures, Dajaks, or some other
benighted people whose religion is less strenuous.</p>

<p>I am glad to be able to say that Juffrouw Laps had passed a good
night. I should like to tell more about her, but I don&rsquo;t care to
exhaust myself.</p>

<p>Stoffel had returned to school, and was trying to inspire the boys
with contempt for riches. He was using on them a poem that had probably
been written in a garret by some poor devil or other whose wealth gave
him little cause for complaint. The boys were inattentive, and seemed
not to grasp the peculiar pleasure in having no money to buy marbles.
Stoffel attributed their hard-heartedness to Walter&rsquo;s crazy
ideas: They had heard of his attack on the Margrave and of that
remarkable visit to the cave.</p>

<p>And Walter?</p>

<p>He still lived in expectation of the punishment he deserved so
richly. For his mother had given him to understand repeatedly that the
little &ldquo;straightening out&rdquo; of the evening before was merely
for practice, and that the reward of his sin would be delayed till she
could speak with the preacher about it.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Walter didn&rsquo;t know what to do. He
couldn&rsquo;t return to school: Pennewip had closed for him that
fountain of knowledge.</p>

<p>Nor was he allowed to go out for a walk. &ldquo;Who knows what he
will do if I let him out of my sight?&rdquo; said his mother, who was
presumably afraid that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href=
"#pb78">78</a>]</span>might make a fresh attack on the cloisters. As a
matter of fact, she denied him this privilege merely because Walter
asked it.</p>

<p>She expressed the opinion that it was best not to let bad children
have their own way.</p>

<p>If Walter had been right wise, he would have pretended to be
thoroughly in love with that dark back room; then, for his moral
improvement, he would have been chased down the steps, and away to his
sawmills.</p>

<p>But Walter was not smart.</p>

<p>He was forbidden to go into the front room because the young ladies
did not care to see him.</p>

<p>That back room was more than dark: It was narrow, and dirty, and
reeked with all the fumes of &ldquo;III, 7, c.&rdquo; But Walter was
used to all this and much more. He had always been a
martyr&mdash;bandages, poultices, bandy legs, biblical history,
rickets, poems on goodness, evening prayers, the judgment day,
hobgoblins for wicked children, closed eyes before and after the slice
of bread, sleeping with crooked knees, committing sins, fear for the
torn breeches, &ldquo;divine service&rdquo; with and without sensible
accompaniment!</p>

<p>That droll robber song, whose origin we know so well, shows how
easily his childish soul was moved by whatever seemed great to him. He
was a pure child, and he was a good boy. He wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt a
fly. The criminal character of his song was due to his desire to grasp
what is greater than everything else and to be the leader in that world
created by his childish fancy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"
href="#pb79">79</a>]</span></p>

<p>Robber&mdash;good! But a first-class robber, a robber of robbers, a
robber without mercy&mdash;for pleasure!</p>

<p>As to the gross mistreatment of women mentioned in his song, he had
no idea what it meant. He used the word for the sake of rhyme, and
because from certain sentences in his book he had got the impression
that it must afford great pleasure.</p>

<p>If, perchance, for those fourteen stivers Grandisson&mdash;weary
remembrance&mdash;had fallen into his hands, his Wednesday&rsquo;s poem
would have been quite different. No doubt he would have sought a
reconciliation with the butcher&rsquo;s Keesje, forgiving him
completely all his liberties with &ldquo;Holland nobility&rdquo; and
even presenting him a few slate pencils.</p>

<p>For that is the striking characteristic of spirits such as
Walter&rsquo;s. Whatever they are, they are that with all their might,
always going further in any direction than they would seem to be
warranted in doing by the mere external circumstances.</p>

<p>From such characters we could hope much, if through some
chance&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, a natural cause, which we call chance,
because we do not <span class="corr" id="xd0e2035" title="Source:
undestand">understand</span> it and are ashamed to admit our
ignorance&mdash;if through some chance they were not born among people
who do not understand them, and, therefore, mistreat them.</p>

<p>It is one of our peculiarities that we like to mistreat anyone whose
soul is differently organized from ours. How does the watch move? asks
the child, and cannot rest until he has torn apart the wheels he could
not understand. There the watch lies in pieces, and the little
miscreant excuses himself with the remark that he just wanted to see
how it was made. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XII</h2>

<p>Walter sat with his elbows on the table, his chin resting in his
hands. He seemed to be deeply interested in Leentje&rsquo;s sewing, but
we shall see in a moment that his thoughts were elsewhere, and, too,
far away from III. 7, c.</p>

<p>They had forbidden her to speak to the shameless rascal, and only
occasionally, when Juffrouw Pieterse left the room, did she have an
opportunity to whisper to him a few words of comfort. To be sure, she
noticed that Walter was not so sad as we should expect one to be who
was caught in between the thrashing of yesterday and the priest of
to-morrow. This gentleman was to come to-morrow to settle the
matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Walter, how could you speak of burning
cloisters!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I meant&mdash;sh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Count&mdash;what had he done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a Margrave&mdash;sh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a count is that? I&rsquo;ll bet he was one out
of another house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was Amalia&rsquo;s father&mdash;but that isn&rsquo;t
it. I have something to tell you, Leentje&mdash;sh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amalia&mdash;who is Amalia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was my bride, but&mdash;Leentje, I wanted to tell you
something&mdash;sh!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=

<p>&ldquo;Your bride! Are you mad, Walter? Your bride?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she was; but now no more. I was going to help
her&mdash;but a duck came&mdash;but that isn&rsquo;t it, Leentje. Now I
see it all&mdash;sh. I swam by&mdash;sh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, what? Swam by?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Amalia. She sat on the rushes&mdash;now I understand it
all&mdash;I am&mdash;sh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand a word, Walter. But the
women&mdash;why did you want to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor innocent Leentje.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The women were in the book&mdash;but listen, I
am&mdash;sh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the cloisters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That has nothing to do with it&mdash;I know everything now.
Listen Leentje, I am&mdash;sh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Heaven sake, Walter, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?
You look as if you were mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter had a vision. He stretched himself up, cast a proud glance at
the beams in the ceiling, placed his right hand over his heart,
extended his left, as if he were draping a Spanish mantle about
him&mdash;remember that he had never been in a theatre&mdash;and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leentje, I am a prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment his mother came in, boxed his ears and sent him out
of the room.</p>

<hr class="tb">
<p>Walter&rsquo;s principality was in the moon&mdash;no, much farther
away.</p>

<p>In the following the reader shall learn how he had attained to this
new dignity.</p>

<p>Long before the beginning of this story&mdash;yes, a long <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>time before
this&mdash;there was a queen of spirits, just like in &ldquo;Hans
Heiling.&rdquo; Her name was A&mdash;&mdash;o.</p>

<p>She did not live in a cave, but held her court far up in the clouds;
and this was airier and more suitable for a queen.</p>

<p>She wore a necklace of stars, and a sun was set in her
signet-ring.</p>

<p>Whenever she went forth, the clouds flew about like dust, and with a
motion of her hand she drove away the firmaments.</p>

<p>Her children played with planets as with marbles, and she complained
that it was so difficult for her to find them again when they had
rolled away under the furniture.</p>

<p>The little son of the queen, <span class="corr" id="xd0e2111" title=
"Source: Price">Prince</span> Upsilon, was peevish over this and was
continually calling for more playthings.</p>

<p>The queen then gave him a sack of siriuses; but in a short time
these, too, were all lost. It was Upsilon&rsquo;s own fault: He ought
to have paid more attention to his playthings.</p>

<p>They tried to satisfy him as best they could, but no matter what
they gave him, he always wanted something else, something larger. This
was a defect in the character of the little prince.</p>

<p>The mother, who, as queen of the spirits, was a very intelligent
woman, thought it would be a good idea for the little prince to
accustom himself to privations.</p>

<p>She issued an order, therefore, that for a certain time Upsilon was
to have no playthings.</p>

<p>The order was carried out. Everything was taken <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>away from him, even
the comet that he and his little sister Omicron happened to be playing
with.</p>

<p>Prince Upsilon was somewhat stubborn. He so far forgot himself one
day as to speak disrespectfully to his mother.</p>

<p>Even Princess Omicron was contaminated by his example&mdash;nothing
is worse than a bad example&mdash;and violently threw her pallet
against the universe. That was not becoming in a girl.</p>

<p>Now, in the kingdom of spirits, there was a law to the effect, that
anyone showing disrespect toward the queen, or throwing anything
against the universe, should be deprived of all titles and dignities
for a certain length of time.</p>

<p>Prince Upsilon became a grain of sand.</p>

<p>After he had behaved himself well in this capacity for a few
centuries he received the news that he had been promoted to be a moss
plant.</p>

<p>Then one morning he woke up and found himself a coral
zo&ouml;phyte.</p>

<p>That occurred about the time that man began to cook his food.</p>

<p>He was industrious, building up islands and continents on the earth.
In recognition of his zeal he was turned into a crab.</p>

<p>In this capacity, too, there could be no complaint against him, and
he was soon transferred to the class of sea-serpents.</p>

<p>He played some innocent pranks on sailors, but he never harmed
anyone. Soon he received four feet and the rank of a mastodon, with the
privilege of roaming over the land. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84"
href="#pb84">84</a>]</span></p>

<p>With the self-control of a philosopher he entered upon his new life,
busying himself with geological investigations.</p>

<p>A few centuries later&mdash;remember that in the kingdom of spirits
all time taken together is only as a short quarter of an hour&mdash;or
to speak more correctly, that all time is nothing. For time was made
merely for man, for his amusement, and given to him just as we give
picture books to children. For spirits, present, past and future are
all the same. They comprehend yesterday, to-day and to-morrow at a
glance, just as one reads a word without spelling it out. What was and
is going to be, <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>The Egyptians and Ph&oelig;nicians knew that very well, but
Christians have forgotten it.</p>

<p>Fancy knew that Walter could not read, so she related
Upsilon&rsquo;s story to him, just as I am doing for the reader.</p>

<p>Some centuries later he had become an elephant; then a moment later,
<i>i. e.</i>, about ten years before the opening of my story&mdash;I
mean years as we mortals reckon them&mdash;he was elevated to the class
of man.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what sins he may have committed as an
elephant.</p>

<p>Anyway, Fancy had said, that in order to return to his station as a
spirit-prince in a short time and escape any further degradation it was
necessary for him to be diligent and well behaved in his present state,
and not write any robber songs, or slip out things and sell
them&mdash;even if it was only a Bible.</p>

<p>And, too, he must become reconciled to seeing Juffrouw <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>Pieterse without a
train on her dress. Fancy said it couldn&rsquo;t be helped.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;Fancy&rdquo; must have been some lady at his
mother&rsquo;s court, who visited him in his exile to comfort and
encourage him, so that he wouldn&rsquo;t think they were punishing him
because they were angry with him.</p>

<p>She promised to visit him from time to time. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
asked Walter, &ldquo;how is my little sister getting along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s being punished, too. You know the law. She is
patient with it all and promises to improve. At first she was a
fire-ball; but she behaved so nicely that she was soon changed to a
moon-beam; and also in this state there was nothing against her. It
seemed to be a pleasure for her; and it was all her mother could do to
keep from shortening the punishment. She was soon turned into vapor,
and stood the test well; for she filled the universe. That was about
the time you began to eat grass. Soon she was a butterfly. But your
mother did not consider this suitable for a girl and had her changed
into a constellation. There she stands before us now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It often happens that we do not see a thing because it is too
big.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Fancy. &ldquo;There&mdash;to the right! No,
further&mdash;there, there&mdash;the north star! That is her left eye.
You can&rsquo;t see her right, because she is bending over towards
Orion, the doll which she holds in her lap and caresses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter saw it plainly enough and cried: &ldquo;Omicron,
Omicron!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86">86</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, prince,&rdquo; said the lady of the court,
&ldquo;that will not do. Each must undergo his punishment alone.
It&rsquo;s already a great concession that you two are imprisoned in
the same universe. Recently, when your little brothers flooded the
milky way with sin, they were separated completely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was sad. How gladly would he have kissed his little
sister!&mdash;that group of stars nursing the doll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Fancy, let me be with Omicron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fancy said neither yes nor no.</p>

<p>She looked as if she were reflecting on the possibility of
accomplishing the almost impossible.</p>

<p>Walter, taking courage from her hesitation, repeated his
request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, let me live with my little sister again, even if I have
to eat grass or build continents&mdash;I will eat and build with
pleasure, if I may only be with Omicron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Probably Fancy was afraid to promise something beyond her power; and
she was sorry not to be able to give her promise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will ask,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;and
now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter rubbed his eyes. There was the bridge and the ditch. He heard
the ducks cackling from the distance. He saw his mills again. Yes, yes,
there they were. But their name was no longer&mdash;what was their
name?</p>

<p>The mills were called &ldquo;Morning Hour&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Eagle,&rdquo; and they called out just like other sawmills:
&ldquo;Karre, karre, kra, kra&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon Walter went home. We have already seen what awaited him
there. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href=
"#pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
</div>

<div id="ch13" class="div1"><span class="pagenum"> [<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XIII</h2>

<p>The preacher had come and gone. Sentence had been passed and the
penalty paid. But Walter was depressed and despondent. Leentje did her
best to put some animation into him, but in vain. Perhaps it was
because she no longer understood her ward.</p>

<p>Those confidential communications of Walter&rsquo;s were beyond her
comprehension; and often she looked at him as if she doubted his
sanity. From her meagre weekly allowance she saved a few doits,
thinking to gladden Walter&rsquo;s heart with some ginger cakes, which
he had always enjoyed. It was no use: Walter&rsquo;s soul had outgrown
ginger cakes. This discovery caused Leentje bitter pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear child, be reasonable, and don&rsquo;t worry over
such foolishness. This Fancy, or whatever the creature&rsquo;s name is,
has mocked you; or you have dreamed it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, Leentje. It&rsquo;s all true. I know everything
she said, and it&rsquo;s all true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Walter, that story about your sister&mdash;you would
have known that long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did know it, but I had forgotten it. I knew everything that
Fancy told me. It had only slipped out of my mind. When she spoke, then
it all came back to me distinctly.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88">88</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go to those mills some day,&rdquo; said Leentje.</p>

<p>And she did it. After Walter&rsquo;s description she was able to
find the place where that important meeting had taken place. She saw
the timbers, the dirt, the ducks, the meadow&mdash;everything was
there, even the ashes,&mdash;everything except Fancy and her
stories.</p>

<p>Nor could Walter find Fancy now. In vain did he go out walking with
those respectable Halleman boys as often as he was in the way at home.
For hours he would stand on the bridge and listen to the rattling of
the sawmills; but they told him nothing, and Fancy would not
return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has too much to do at my mother&rsquo;s court,&rdquo;
Walter sighed, and went home sad and disappointed.</p>

<p>When he looked out the window and saw the beautiful stars twinkling
encouragement to him, he cheered up a little. His sadness was less
bitter, but it was still there. Pain passed into home-sickness, a sweet
longing for home, and with tears in his eyes, but no longer despairing,
he whispered &ldquo;Omicron, Omicron!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Who heard that call, or understood his grief over his exile? Who
observed how that sigh for the &ldquo;higher&rdquo; and that fiery
desire had passed into a nobler state?</p>

<p>After long deliberations and Walter&rsquo;s express promise to do
better, Master Pennewip had at last been prevailed upon to allow our
young robber to return to school. He now had the opportunity to perfect
himself in verse-writing, penmanship, verbs, &ldquo;Holland
Counts&rdquo; and other equally important things.</p>

<p>The teacher said that the boy at Muiderberg had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>been still worse,
and he had known what to prescribe. Walter would do all right now, he
thought; but Juffrouw Pieterse must get another pastor, for the present
one belonged to the class of &ldquo;drinkers.&rdquo; This she did.
Walter was to receive religious instruction from a real preacher.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the title of the book, but the first lines
were:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Q.</i> From whom did you and everything in existence have
its origin?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Walter wanted to say, From my mother; but the book said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ans.</i> From God, who made everything out of
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Q.</i> How do you know that?<span class="corr" id=
"xd0e2265" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ans.</i> From nature and revelation.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Walter didn&rsquo;t know what it meant, but like the good-natured,
obedient child that he was, he repeated faithfully what he had
memorized from the book. It was annoying for him to have his Sundays
spoiled by recitations in the Kings of Israel&mdash;days so well suited
for rambling. He was jealous of the Jews, who were always led
away&mdash;a misfortune that seemed delightful to him. But he worked
away patiently, and was not the worst of those apprentices in religion.
At the end of the year he received a book containing three hundred and
sixty-five scriptural texts, twenty-one prayers, as many graces, the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, the ten commandments and the articles of faith. It
also contained directions for using it&mdash;once a day through the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>year,
three times a day for a week, etc., etc.; or simply use as needed. On a
leaf pasted in the front of the book was written:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="aligncenter"><i>To Walter Pieterse</i><br>
as a<br>
<i>Reward</i><br>
for<br>
<i>Excellent recitations</i><br>
in the<br>
<i>Noorderkerk</i><br>
and as an<br>
<i>Encouragement</i><br>
for him to continue to<br>
<i>Honor God</i><br>
in the manner in which he has begun.</p>
</div>

<p>Under this were the names of the preacher and the officers of the
church, ornamented with flourishes that would have put Pennewip to
shame.</p>

<p>The outward respectability of the Hallemans continued to increase.
The parents of these children had hired a garden on the
&ldquo;Overtoom.&rdquo; That was so &ldquo;far out,&rdquo; they said;
and then they &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t stay in the city forever.&rdquo;
Besides, the expense was &ldquo;not so much&rdquo;; for there was one
gardener for everybody; and then, there were plenty of berries growing
there, and that was always very nice. There would be grass enough for
bleaching the linen&mdash;an important item, for just lately, said the
mother of the Hallemans, there had been iron-rust in Betty&rsquo;s
dress. For that reason it was the very thing to rent the garden; and if
people said anything about it, it would only be because they were
jealous. And, too, there was a barrel there for rainwater; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>and Mrs. Karels had
said it leaked, but it was not true; for everyone must know what
he&rsquo;s doing; but when you do anything, everybody is talking about
it. If one paid any attention to it, one would never get anything
done&mdash;and it would be such a recreation for the children. Juffrouw
Karels ought to attend to her own business&mdash;and when
Gustave&rsquo;s birthday came, he might invite some &ldquo;young
gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gustave&rsquo;s birthday came. &ldquo;Young gentlemen&rdquo; were to
be invited, and&mdash;Walter was among that select number.</p>

<p>It would lead me too far from the subject to enter upon an
investigation of the motives that prompted Gustave and Franz to invite
their former partner in the peppermint business. The list was made out
and approved by their mother; and as Juffrouw Pieterse felt flattered,
there was no objection from her side. Walter must promise, of course,
to behave properly and be &ldquo;respectable,&rdquo; not to soil his
clothes, not to wrestle and tear his clothes, and many other things of
a similar nature. Juffrouw Pieterse added that it was a great favor on
her part to let him go, for such visits made a lot of work for her.</p>

<p>Yes, Walter was to make a visit! Eat, drink and enjoy himself under
a strange roof. It was a great event in his life, and already he was
becoming less jealous of the Jews, who went away so often, and finally
never came back home at all.</p>

<p>It was midday now&mdash;that glorious midday. With <span class=
"corr" id="xd0e2330" title="Source: indiscribable">indescribable</span>
dignity, for a boy, Walter stepped through the gate-way. &ldquo;A
little to right&mdash;to the left, to the left again, then over a
bridge, and then to the right <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=
"#pb92">92</a>]</span>straight ahead. You can&rsquo;t miss it,&rdquo;
Gustave had said. The name of the garden was &ldquo;City Rest,&rdquo;
so all Walter had to do was to &ldquo;ask,&rdquo; and he would
&ldquo;find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it was.</p>

<p>Anyone making a call or visit for the first time always arrives too
early. So it was with Walter, who reached City Rest before any of the
other guests. But the boys received him cordially and presented him to
their mother, who said that Walter had a pretty face, if it were only
not so pale.</p>

<p>The other playmates came then, and running and throwing began, in
the customary boyish style. This was interrupted with waffles and
lemonade, which they &ldquo;must drink quite slowly,&rdquo; because
they were &ldquo;wet with perspiration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the proud mother of the Hallemans was speaking of berries and
the grossly slandered rainwater barrel, she might have mentioned the
advantages of the leafy bower, where Betty was now sitting with a
gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; asked Walter of little Emma, who was
playing with the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That? That&rsquo;s Betty&rsquo;s sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that touching story of slender Cecilia we know that Walter
already had his first love affair behind him; but still Emma&rsquo;s
statement was to him something new. Up to that time he had thought that
a sweetheart was a girl to whom one gives slatepencils and bonbons. But
she seemed to be above such things. Walter saw immediately that he had
not taken the right course with Cecilia; and all at once a desire <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>came over him
to know how a grown man treats a girl who is through school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;engag&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That word was too modern for Walter. If the reader is sharp he can
calculate in what year that girl married the barber&rsquo;s apprentice.
All that is necessary is to determine when that stupid engag&eacute;
came into use in this sense in &ldquo;III. 7, a.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; asked Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Engag&eacute;&mdash;they go together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re going to get married. Don&rsquo;t you
know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was ashamed not to know such a simple thing; and, as is often
the case, he was ashamed of being ashamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, of course I know. I hadn&rsquo;t understood right
well. Emma&mdash;will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the moment Emma was unable to accommodate him, as she was
engag&eacute; with her mother; but as soon as she was free she would
consider the matter, and Walter would probably be favored. She looked
at him sweetly&mdash;and then the game called her to another part of
the yard.</p>

<p>Love is the instinct for unity&mdash;and the instinct for
multiplicity. As everywhere, nature is simple here in principle, but
manifold in application. The love of a thief means: Come, we will go
steal together. The servant of the Word unites with his loved one in
prayer and psalm, etc., every animal after his kind. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94">94</a>]</span></p>

<p>Or is this instinct to share, to be together, to be united at the
same the instinct for the good?</p>

<p>In Walter&rsquo;s case it was, even though he himself did not know
it. Had he not, in the name of Cecilia, liberated a bird that fluttered
about its narrow cage in distress? Of course Cecilia had laughed and
asked Walter if he was crazy. She did not know that there was any
connection between his sympathy for the poor little bird and the
beating of his heart when he scratched her name on the frozen
window-pane in the back room. Perhaps she would have understood if she
had loved Walter; but that was impossible, because he still wore his
jacket stuffed in his trousers.</p>

<p>At all events, it was not possible for him to think of anything bad
when he called &ldquo;Omicron.&rdquo; He had now forgotten Cecilia, and
would have been greatly surprised if she had appeared in answer to his
call. Little Emma would have come nearer meeting his requirements.</p>

<p>Walter felt that he must know just how the young man was proceeding
with Betty in the bower. He soon found an excuse to separate himself
from his companions; and then he heard all sorts of things that did not
make him much wiser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I said so too. In May&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, on account of the top
story&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s annoying! And what does your mother
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm&mdash;she says we must wait another year, that it
isn&rsquo;t respectable to get married in such a hurry&mdash;it&rsquo;s
just as if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four years&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb95" href="#pb95">95</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, four years. Louw and Anna have been engaged for
seven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was proud that he knew exactly what it all meant. To rent an
upper story together, preferably in May!&mdash;that was the way he
understood it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you get that press for the linen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother wants to keep it. But if we will only wait a year
she will give us another one&mdash;a small one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The big one would have been nicer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so too, but she says young people don&rsquo;t need a
big press. But when my sister was married she got a big one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell them you want a big one too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try it. I won&rsquo;t marry without that big one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will make them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a fair sample of what Walter overheard. He was dissatisfied
and slipped away and hid himself, lost in thought. He didn&rsquo;t even
know himself what was the matter with him; but when Emma came and
called him he looked as if he had been thinking of anything else but
presses and vacant flats, for in a tone at once joyous and fearful he
cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it be she&mdash;my little sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was evening now, and the children were to continue their games
indoors. As the little party was tired, one of the grown-ups was going
to tell a story.</p>

<p>Just what &ldquo;grown-up&rdquo; had been requisitioned to narrate
the story of Paradise and Peri, I don&rsquo;t know. Anyway the story
hardly harmonized with Betty&rsquo;s <i>engagement</i> and that
love-obstructing clothes-press. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96"
href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>But just as Fortune is said to smile on
everyone once in a lifetime, so, in the midst of the flatness and
insipidity of everyday life, it seems that something always happens
which gives that one who lays hold of it opportunity to lift himself
above the ordinary and commonplace. To the drowning man a voice calls:
&ldquo;Stretch out thy arms, thou canst swim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After Peri had begged long, but in vain, at the gates of
paradise to be admitted to the land of the blessed, she brought at
last, as the most beautiful thing in the world, the sigh of a repentant
sinner; and she found favor with the keeper of the gate on account of
the sacredness of the gift she had brought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play forfeits now!&rdquo; cried Gustave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forfeits! Forfeits!&rdquo; everybody called out after
him.</p>

<p>And they played forfeits. Pawns were redeemed; and of course there
was some kissing done. Riddles were given that nobody could guess; and
who ever knew must not tell&mdash;a usual condition in this game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavy, heavy hangs over your head; what shall the owner do to
possess it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand on one leg for five minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him jump over a straw&mdash;or recite a poem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, a fable&mdash;la cigale, or something like
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Walter&rsquo;s pawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any fable,&rdquo; he said, embarrassed;
&ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know French either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will help you,&rdquo; cried Emma. &ldquo;Le pere, du
pere&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97">97</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no fable! Go ahead, Walter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some of the party it was a joy that Walter knew no Fable and no
French. If it were only known how often one can do a kindness by being
stupid, perhaps many, out of love for humanity, would affect
stupidity.</p>

<p>But Walter did not think of the pleasure of the others&mdash;which
he could not have understood. He wept, and was angry at Master
Pennewip, who had taught him no French and no fable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forward, Walter, forward!&rdquo; insisted the holder of the
pawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It needn&rsquo;t be French. Just tell a fable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know what a fable is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a story with animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, or with trees! <span lang="fr">Le ch&ecirc;ne un jour
dit au roseau</span>&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see, you can have one
without animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, a fable is just a story&mdash;nothing else. You can
have in it anything you want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it must rhyme!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was thinking about reciting his robber song, but fortunately
he reconsidered the matter. That would have been scandalous in the home
of the Hallemans, who were so particularly respectable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried another, who was again wiser than all the
rest, &ldquo;it needn&rsquo;t rhyme. The cow gives milk&mdash;Jack saw
the plums hanging&mdash;Prince William the First was a great thinker.
Don&rsquo;t you see, Walter, it&rsquo;s as easy as rolling off of a
log. Go ahead and tell something, or else you won&rsquo;t get your
pawn.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98">98</a>]</span></p>

<p>Walter began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little boy died once who was not allowed to go to
heaven&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho! That&rsquo;s the story of Peri. Tell something
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to change it,&rdquo; said Walter, embarrassed.
&ldquo;And so the little boy couldn&rsquo;t enter the heavenly gates,
because he didn&rsquo;t know French, and because he had sometimes been
bad, and because he hadn&rsquo;t learned his lessons, and also because
he&mdash;because he&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;I believe Walter had something
on the end of his tongue about his mother&rsquo;s box of savings, but
he swallowed it, that he might not offend the Hallemans by any allusion
to the peppermint business&mdash;&ldquo;because he once laughed during
prayers. For it is certain, boys, that if you laugh during prayers
you&rsquo;ll never get to heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;o-oo?&rdquo; asked several, conscious of their
guilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they can&rsquo;t go to heaven. Now the boy had had a
sister, who died one year before him. He had loved her a lot, and when
he died he began to hunt for his sister right away. &lsquo;Who is your
sister?&rsquo; he was asked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who asked him that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be still! Don&rsquo;t interrupt him. Let Walter tell his
story!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who asked that. The boy said that his
little sister had on a blue dress and had dimples in her cheeks,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like Emma!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, exactly like Emma. They told him that there was a little
girl in heaven that looked just like that. <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb99" href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>She had come the year before, and
had asked them to let her brother in, who would certainly inquire after
her. But the boy could not go in. I have already said why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had the little girl always learned her lessons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! Don&rsquo;t you see she had? Let Walter go on with
his story!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was sad that he could not get to see his sister any more.
He felt that it hadn&rsquo;t really been worth the trouble to die.
&lsquo;Oh, just let me in!&rsquo; he begged the gentleman at the
door&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the gate!&rdquo; corrected several simultaneously, who,
though untouched by the sublimity of Walter&rsquo;s conception of
death, were offended by the commonplaceness of the word door. But such
things happen frequently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Walter. He was ashamed that he had
offended against propriety. &ldquo;The gentleman at the gate said,
&lsquo;No!&rsquo; and then the poor boy returned to the
earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; cried the philosophical
contingency, &ldquo;whoever is dead remains dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt him. Of course it&rsquo;s only a
story!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter continued: &ldquo;He returned to the earth and learned
French. Then he appeared at the gate again and said, &lsquo;Oui,
Monsieur!&rsquo; but it did no good; he was not admitted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think not; he ought to have said:
&lsquo;j&rsquo;aime, tu aimes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about that,&rdquo; Walter
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he went to the earth again and learned his lessons till
he could say them backwards. He did <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>this for the keeper of the gate;
but all this did no good; he was not allowed to go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; cried one of the wise ones, &ldquo;to
get to heaven you must be confirmed. Had he been confirmed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s the reason it was so difficult. Then he
tried something else. He said that he was engaged to his
sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like Betty,&rdquo; cried Emma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, like Betty&mdash;and that he loved her and wanted to
marry her. But it was all of no use; they wouldn&rsquo;t let him into
heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finally he didn&rsquo;t dare go to the gate any more, for
fear the keeper would get angry at him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then? What happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Walter stuttered. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what he ought to do to get to heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter knew the rest of the story very well, but he couldn&rsquo;t
put it into words. This was shown in a peculiar manner an hour
later.</p>

<p>On the way home the party was almost run over by a wagon just as
they were crossing a bridge. In the commotion Emma slipped under the
railing and fell into the stream. Somebody screamed, and Walter sprang
after her.</p>

<p>If he had died at that moment the keeper of the gate would hardly
have turned him away because he didn&rsquo;t know French and had not
been confirmed.</p>

<p>When he was brought home, wet and dirty, Juffrouw Pieterse said that
one ought not to tempt the Master, and that&rsquo;s what one did when
one jumped into the water without being able to swim. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101">101</a>]</span></p>

<p>But I find that the man who can&rsquo;t swim is the very one to
expect something of the Master; for the man who can swim has some
prospect of helping himself.</p>

<p>And Juffrouw Pieterse complained that there was &ldquo;always
something the matter with that boy.&rdquo; There was something the
matter with him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
</div>

<div id="ch14" class="div1"><span class="pagenum"> [<a href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XIV</h2>

<p>Juffrouw Pieterse must have inherited something, for all at once the
Pieterses moved to a more respectable neighborhood, and the daughters
no longer knew any of the girls that they used to sew with. Such things
do happen in cases of inheritance, when one moves to a more select
quarter. Besides, there were other signs. They exerted themselves in
trying to get Leentje to speak &ldquo;better Dutch.&rdquo; Stoffel was
zealous in teaching her, but Juffrouw Pieterse spoiled everything by
her bad example.</p>

<p>Walter was now wearing a new jacket, with a small collar, such as
cabmen wore later. For him a jacket to stuff in the trousers was a
thing of the past. It &ldquo;looked so babyish,&rdquo; the young ladies
said, and was &ldquo;out of the question now when the boy can write
poetry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That Walter could write poetry was boasted of to everybody that
would listen. Under the circumstances they really had no right to reap
any fame from Walter&rsquo;s robber song; but this only showed what an
important r&ocirc;le vanity plays in the world. Of course he himself
never heard anything of this; it was mentioned only when he was not
present.</p>

<p>The image of Cecilia had disappeared from Walter&rsquo;s <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>heart; and
little Emma was forgotten. Omicron must show her face in the stars from
time to time to remind the child of his love. And even when he looked
at the evening sky and his soul was stirred by an inexpressible longing
after the good, it was not so much that he was thinking of Omicron as
that he was moved by vague sweet memories. In the twelve years of his
life there was a mythical prehistoric period which was difficult to
separate from the historical period.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t know that he could write verses. He accepted it as a
matter of course that his robber song was very poor, and looked upon
Klaasje van der Gracht with awe. It was from Juffrouw Laps he learned
that he could write poetry; and it was an illumination for him.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps had an uncle whose birthday was coming the next week.
She had paid the Pieterses a swell visit to ask if Walter
wouldn&rsquo;t write her a poem for the occasion. She would see that he
got some bonbons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Juffrouw Pieterse, you must tell him that it must be
religious and that my uncle is a widower. He must bring that in. I
should like for it to be in the melody of the 103d psalm, for my uncle
has that psalm in his lyre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reader will note that she did not mean the lyre of Apollo. What
she spoke of was a thing that turned, and made a screechy noise.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Pieterse was going to speak with Walter about it when he
came from school, but first she had to consider the matter with
Stoffel, to decide whether it should be a request or a command, so that
Walter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104">104</a>]</span>would have no reason to be
&ldquo;stuck-up.&rdquo; For that she could not endure in a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walter, did you know your lesson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother; I had to learn thirteen mountains in Asia, and I
knew only nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, that won&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;m paying tuition
for nothing. Do you think money grows on my back? I don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s to become of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After all, though, Walter was flattered by the commission to write a
poem. Stoffel&rsquo;s and Juffrouw Pieterse&rsquo;s efforts to conceal
their real opinion of his poetical talents had been useless. It was a
pleasant surprise for the boy to learn that he was looked up to. He had
always heard that he was worse than worthless, and that he would never
amount to anything. It interested him now to hear the assurance of his
mother and Stoffel that the commission was only a punishment for not
knowing the mountains in Asia. In a great rush Stoffel taught him the
difference between &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; and &ldquo;feminine&rdquo;
verses, explaining that these must alternate, that all must be of the
same length, and that if at any time the boy was in doubt he would
clear the matter up, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Walter was delighted. He went to the back room, got a slate pencil
and began to write. It could hardly be called a success. &ldquo;A
widower of God&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;O God, a widower!&rdquo; That was as
far as he got.</p>

<p>He gnawed on the pencil till he had pulverized it and worn out his
teeth, but it wouldn&rsquo;t go. He was continually being interrupted
by Stoffel&rsquo;s masculine and feminine verses. He had been too
proud, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=
"#pb105">105</a>]</span>now he was receiving his punishment. He began
to believe that his mother was right when she said nothing would ever
come of him.</p>

<p>Nor could Leentje help him. So he determined to make another attempt
to-morrow. Perhaps he could do better then. Leentje agreed with
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Juffrouw Pieterse. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t disgrace us all. Remember, I told Juffrouw Laps you could
do it; and the man&rsquo;s birthday comes Thursday week. So you
haven&rsquo;t any too much time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter went to Ash Gate, found his bridge and began to weep
bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what&rsquo;s the matter with that boy,&rdquo; he heard a
woman saying to a girl fourteen or fifteen years old. &ldquo;Perhaps he
has lost something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you lost anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter looked up, and was surprised; for he seemed to have seen that
face before. It reminded him of Fancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, everything will be all right There you are; and I have
been hunting for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, but I just didn&rsquo;t know it. But I know it now.
Tell me right quick how to write the poem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl, who was helping her mother place the linen on the grass
for bleaching, looked at Walter in astonishment. She hurried back to
her mother to say that she didn&rsquo;t know what was the matter with
the boy, but that there was certainly something wrong. &ldquo;He looks
as if he were scared half to death,&rdquo; she decided.</p>

<p>Then she ran and fetched water from the house near <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>by and made
Walter drink. He saw that he had made a mistake; but there was
something in the manner of the girl that drew him to her irresistibly,
even though her name was only Femke. So the mother addressed her. And
this name reminded him of Fancy, which was something.</p>

<p>Femke pointed to an inverted basket and told him to tell the cause
of his trouble; and Walter did it as well as he could, while the mother
was busy with the linen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can help you,&rdquo; the mother said. &ldquo;I have a
nephew who is a widower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Juffrouw&mdash;but the poem? And there must be something
about God in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. It&rsquo;s a long story. His wife was a niece of
my husband&rsquo;s&mdash;you see we are Catholics, and she acted
according to her religion&mdash;put a stone on those cloths, Femke, or
they&rsquo;ll blow away&mdash;yes, bleaching is a job. You have no idea
what a bother it is&mdash;yes, she acted according to her religion; and
that was right. People that don&rsquo;t do that are not much. But
he&mdash;draw that shirt back a little, Femke. The sleeve is hanging in
the ditch&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t believe in it, and said it was all
nonsense. But when she died, and he saw all that was done for
her&mdash;it was Father Jansen who was there. Of course you know
him&mdash;he always walks with a black cane, but he never lets it touch
the ground&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The women looked at Walter questioningly. The poor boy sat on the
basket, his elbows on his knees, his chin in his hands. He had listened
with open mouth, wondering how he was going to apply it all to his
poem. Of Father Jansen and that cane which <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb107" href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>despised the ground he had
never heard. This he had to confess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was Father Jansen who was there, and when my
husband&rsquo;s nephew saw all that&mdash;don&rsquo;t spill any, Femke,
or the mud will splatter so bad&mdash;yes, when he saw that a human
being doesn&rsquo;t die like an animal, then he was more respectful,
and after that he observed Easter like other people. And last year when
he broke his leg&mdash;he&rsquo;s a dyer, you know&mdash;he drew
thirteen stivers for nine weeks. And so I wanted to tell you that
there&rsquo;s a widower in our family. And now you must get up, for I
need the basket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter arose quickly, as if he feared he might seem to be
trespassing; and the woman went away, after having warned Femke to
watch the linen and call her if any bad boys should come along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you better now?&rdquo; Femke asked kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; but I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m to use all that
in my poem. You must remember that it has to rhyme, and the verses must
be of the same length, and that they must be masculine and feminine;
for my brother said so, and he&rsquo;s a school-teacher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Femke reflected, then all at once she cried, &ldquo;Do you know
Latin?&rdquo; As if Latin would help Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; disconsolately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it really makes no difference. It&rsquo;s in Dutch,
too. Just watch the linen a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter promised, and Femke ran to the house.</p>

<p>Then some boys came along throwing rocks. Walter, conscious of his
responsibility, called to them to desist&mdash;or words to that effect.
This only made them worse. They came closer, and, to worry Walter,
began <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108">108</a>]</span>to walk over the linen. For him it was as if
they were mistreating Femke, and he charged on the miscreants. But it
was two against one, and a weaker one at that; so he would have soon
been defeated if his lady had not returned quickly. She rescued him and
drove off his assailants; and when she saw that his lip was bleeding
she gave him a kiss. The boy&rsquo;s heart trembled; all at once his
soul was lifted to an unfamiliar level; and for the first time in weeks
he felt again that princely nature that had given Leentje such a
fright. His eyes shone, and the boy, who but a moment ago did not know
how he was to write some rhymes, was filled with the feelings and
emotions that make poets of men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Fancy, Fancy, to die for thee&mdash;to die with such a kiss
on the lips!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It hurt him to think that the boys were gone. If there had been ten
of them he would have had courage for the unequal fight.</p>

<p>And Femke, who had never heard of poetical overflows, understood him
immediately, for she was a pure, innocent girl. She felt Walter&rsquo;s
chivalry, and knew that she was the lady to reward it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a dear sweet boy,&rdquo; she said, taking his head
between her hands and kissing him again, and again&mdash;as if she had
done something of this kind before. But such was not the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you must read the verses in the little book. Maybe it
will help you to write for your aunt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t my aunt,&rdquo; Walter said, &ldquo;but of
course I will look through the book.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb109" href="#pb109">109</a>]</span></p>

<p>He laid it on the railing of the bridge and began to read. Femke,
who was taller than he, had put one arm around his neck, while with the
other hand she was pointing out what he should read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the lines are
the same length.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they don&rsquo;t rhyme.&rdquo; And Walter read:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">Mother most pure,</p>

<p class="line">Mother undefiled,</p>

<p class="line">Virgin most powerful,</p>

<p class="line">Virgin most merciful,</p>

<p class="line">Virgin most faithful,</p>

<p class="line">Spiritual vessel,</p>

<p class="line">Vessel of honor,</p>

<p class="line">Vessel of singular devotion,</p>

<p class="line">Mystical rose,</p>

<p class="line">Tower of David,</p>

<p class="line">Tower of Ivory,</p>

<p class="line">Gate of Heaven&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;But, Femke, how am I to use that for my poem? I don&rsquo;t
understand any of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Femke didn&rsquo;t understand much of it either. She had been
reading the book every day for the past four or five years, and she had
always been satisfied with her comprehension of it. But now she saw
that she was as ignorant about it as Walter. She was ashamed and closed
the book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you know what Faith is?&rdquo; she asked, as
if this defect might account for the general ignorance of both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that way,&rdquo; Walter replied. &ldquo;I learned it
another way.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href=
"#pb110">110</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But you believe in Jesus, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. That&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s son. But I didn&rsquo;t
learn anything about vessels and towers. Do they belong to
faith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly! But you know the holy virgin,
Maria!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So? Maria? No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Purgatory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And confession?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you do then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, Femke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to be saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Walter replied. &ldquo;You mean,
to get to heaven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly. That&rsquo;s the point. And you can&rsquo;t
do that without the holy virgin and such a book. Shall I teach you the
creed, Walter? Then we&rsquo;ll be together in heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That pleased Walter, and Femke and Walter began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;God created the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he do before that, Femke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But the people were made wicked by a
snake; then the Pope pronounced a curse upon the snake, for the Pope
lives in Rome, you know. And then Jesus was crucified to make the
people good again. That was a long time ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Walter said, &ldquo;Jesus changed the
number of the year. At his birth he began at nought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Femke didn&rsquo;t know again. In this way each supplemented the
knowledge of the other; and Walter was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb111" href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>proud that he knew something about
the creed, even if Femke did think it the wrong creed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so Jesus made the people good again, and if you will pray
out of such a book you will be saved. Do you understand,
Walter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite. What is an ivory tower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s only a name for the virgin. It&rsquo;s as
if you were to call the pastor father. Now you understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Femke hunted for another illustration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a mother; what do you call her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I call her mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Correct. What do the other people call her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They call her Juffrouw Pieterse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so. When we call the holy virgin &lsquo;ivory
tower&rsquo; it&rsquo;s just like calling your mother Juffrouw
Pieterse. Ivory gate means that to get to heaven we must go through the
holy virgin. That&rsquo;s the main thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Femke, what is a virgin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Femke blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is anybody that has never had a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; asked Walter in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, child, it must be a girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a virgin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Femke spoke the unvarnished truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;because I&rsquo;m not married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Maria was married&mdash;and Jesus was her
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s where the holiness comes in,&rdquo; replied
Femke. &ldquo;And for that reason she is called the ivory gate. Do you
understand now, Walter?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112"
href="#pb112">112</a>]</span></p>

<p>Walter did not understand; but he asked permission to take the book
home with him, that he might study it. That, however, was not possible,
as Femke needed the book every day. Walter consoled himself easily, for
not for anything in the world would he have endangered Femke&rsquo;s
salvation. Femke asked him to come again. She would be glad to tell him
all she knew about the matter; and, if both should get tangled up, she
would ask Father Jansen about it. And then Walter would soon be as wise
as she was.</p>

<p>Walter withdrew; <i>i. e.</i>, after he had kissed Femke heartily.
This meeting with her, the mysterious book, salvation, the fight with
the boys&mdash;all these things would run through his mind whenever he
tried to think of the poem. It seemed to him that there was some
connection between them.</p>

<p>When he got home he turned through Stoffel&rsquo;s books, hoping to
find something about holy vessels, ivory towers, and immaculate
virgins. But they were all school books, and gave information about
everything else but salvation. Walter was crushed, but he was still
searching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Pennewip had a father and mother; and certainly old
Pennewip, too, who slaughtered hogs; and the one before him,
too&mdash;but who was the first Pennewip? And who slaughtered the hogs
before old Pennewip? And before there were any hogs, what did butchers
do? And&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will know all of that some day, Walter thought. If he could have
only quieted himself so well about his poem! If that were only written,
he thought, then he would clear up the lost causes of everything. In
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113">113</a>]</span>meanwhile he dreamed of Femke, of her blue
eyes, her friendliness, her soft lips&mdash;and of her voice, when she
said, &ldquo;You are a dear, sweet boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Could it be that she is Omicron? he thought.</p>

<p>And thus the child dreamed, dreamed; and, just as in the development
of humanity, in his life was working a three-fold impulse, towards
love, knowledge, and conflict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Walter, don&rsquo;t you read any books at home about the
creed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Femke questioned her little friend the next day, as he sat on
her basket again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they&rsquo;re not pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know anything by heart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter repeated a stanza of a reformed church hymn. This found no
favor with Femke; though she liked his reciting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you read anything else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter reflected: he flew through Stoffel&rsquo;s
library&mdash;works of the Poetical Society, Geology by Ippel, On
Orthography, Regulations for the Fire-Watch, Story of Joseph by <span
class="corr" id="xd0e2819" title="Source: H&uuml;lshoff">
Hulshoff</span>, Brave Henry, Jacob Among His Children, Sermons by
<span class="corr" id="xd0e2822" title="Source: Hellendoorm">
Hellendoorn</span>, A Catechism by the same, Hoorn&rsquo;s
Song-book.</p>

<p>He felt that all of this would not prove very imposing for Femke.
Finally:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do know something, but it isn&rsquo;t about faith and the
creed. It&rsquo;s about Glorioso.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Femke promised to listen, and he began to relate the story. At first
he spoke mechanically, using all the &ldquo;and then&rsquo;s&rdquo;:
but soon he put himself into the soul of the hero and told the story
better than he had read it in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>the greasy book. At every deed of Glorioso
he would spring from the basket and act the part of that hero in a way
that made Femke&rsquo;s blood run cold. Still, how magnificent she
found it! And when at last he was through, a spark from his peculiar
but sincere enthusiasm had fallen into her heart, which like his beat
with delight over the beauty of what she had heard. Her cheeks
glowed&mdash;really, if a Treckschent had started to Italy at that
moment I believe she would have gone along, in order to take part in so
much danger and adventure&mdash;and <i>love</i>. The nicest thing about
the story was that it showed how firm such a robber is in the
faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know another story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;One more. It&rsquo;s in a
little book&mdash;a calendar, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he related the story of Telasco and Kusco and the beautiful
Aztalpa.</p>

<p>Telasco and Kusco, sons of the King of the Sun-worshipers, were
twins; and so both were equally near the throne. They loved each other
devotedly; so which would give way for the other? Which of the two was
to become Inca? Funeral pyres were built, one for each, and prayers
were offered to the sun that one of the piles might be ignited. But the
sun did not light either. He ordered that Aztalpa, the sister, should
choose one. That one to whom she offered her hand should inherit the
throne and the empire. But the princess could not decide, for she loved
them both dearly and both equally. It was then decided that both should
go out hunting on a certain morning, and that the one who killed the
first doe should become king. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115"
href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>Telasco had red arrows, Kusco blue. The
morning came. The brothers were lying in a thicket as the deer
approached. Both fired, and both missed. Then they swore mutually not
to miss intentionally the next time. They kept the oath, and two deer
fell; but Telasco had shot one of Kusco&rsquo;s arrows, and Kusco one
of Telasco&rsquo;s. Telasco then proposed that Aztalpa should be
killed, to avoid any discord in the empire; and in the other world both
would enjoy the same place in her affections. All agreed to this; but
when the fatal day came, Aztalpa fell on her knees before Telasco and
begged that she might receive her death at the hand of Kusco. Telasco
cried: &ldquo;Aztalpa, you have chosen!&rdquo; All bowed down before
Kusco; and when they looked for Telasco he had disappeared. He was
never seen again.</p>

<p>Often Femke interrupted with questions, for there was much that was
strange and wonderful to her; but she was charmed with the story and
shared all of Walter&rsquo;s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, though, Walter, if that girl had known what
Telasco was up to she wouldn&rsquo;t have done it. But the story is
beautiful. I wonder if such things really happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was far from here, Femke, and a long time ago.
That&rsquo;s just the way it was in the book. But now I must go home,
for I haven&rsquo;t a stiver to pay the gate-keeper if I come in after
eight. Oh, Femke&mdash;if I were only through with that poetry
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will turn out all right<span class="corr" id="xd0e2854"
title="Source: ,">.</span> Just think of Telasco. He had a difficult
task, too.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href=
"#pb116">116</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I will think of the girl. Good-evening,
Femke&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter received the hearty kiss that his story had earned him, and
dreaming of Aztalpa, who was guarding the linen, he passed through the
Ash Gate and turned towards home. The moon shone so brightly that he
was annoyed not to have been able to remain with Femke. How much
better, he thought, could he have told his story by moonlight! But he
didn&rsquo;t have the price&mdash;a stiver. <span class="pagenum">[<a

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XV</h2>

<p>The moon paused on the sky, as if she were weary of her lonely lot.
Was she grieved because ungrateful humanity had fallen asleep and was
ignoring her?&mdash;or because of the light borrowed from her for
thousands of years, and none returned? She poured forth her sorrow in
heart-breaking noiseless elegies till the night-wind was moved to pity.
Whish! he went through the trees; and the leaves danced. Crash! he went
over the roof; and the tiles flew away, and chimneys bowed meekly; and
over the walls and ditches the sawmills danced with the logs they were
to saw. There a girl sat sleeping. Could it be Femke? The linen danced
about her to the music of the wind, the shirts making graceful bows and
extending their sleeves. Nightcaps, dickeys and drawers danced the
minuet; stockings, skirts, collars, handkerchiefs waltzed thicker and
thicker around the sleeping girl. Her curls began to flutter&mdash;a
smile, a sigh, and she sprang to her feet. A whirlwind caught her up
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, heavens, Femke, Femke!&rdquo; and Walter grasped at the
apparition that was being borne away towards the moon in a cloud of
stockings, socks, drawers, shirts and collars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother! Walter&rsquo;s pinching me,&rdquo; cried Laurens,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>the
printer&rsquo;s apprentice; and Juffrouw Pieterse groaned, that those
boys couldn&rsquo;t even keep quiet at night.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;House of Pieterse&rdquo; gathered at Walter&rsquo;s bed.
There was the noble mother of the family enveloped in a venerable
jacket that fell in broad folds over a black woolen skirt. There was
Trudie, with her stupid blue eyes; and Myntje and Pietje&mdash;but what
am I talking about? In the new home Trudie had become Gertrude, like a
morganatic princess in Hessia; and Myntje was now Mina, but preferred
to be called Mine, as that sounded more Frenchy. But her stupid face
remained unchanged. Pietje was now Pietro. Stoffel had said that was a
very swell name.</p>

<p>Stoffel, too, had now appeared on the scene, to the great
astonishment of his mother, who expected so much of him. This fine
sense of propriety had been developed in the new home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, boy?&rdquo; cried everybody
at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, Femke&mdash;Femke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy is foolish.&rdquo; That was the unanimous verdict of
the family.</p>

<p>And they were not altogether wrong. Walter was delirious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are carrying her away&mdash;around and
around&mdash;Daughter of the Sun, decide&mdash;here is
Telasco&mdash;thou shalt die, Aztalpa&mdash;Femke, stay, stay, I will
watch the clothes&mdash;I will shoot the doe&mdash;a widower of
God&mdash;together through the ivory gate&mdash;there she is
again&mdash;stay, Omicron!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ought we to call in a preacher?&rdquo; asked Juffrouw <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>Pieterse
hesitatingly. She didn&rsquo;t know whether praying was needed or a
whipping&mdash;or both.</p>

<p>And now, perhaps for the first time in his life, Stoffel expressed a
sensible thought: &ldquo;Mother, we ought to have a doctor. Walter is
sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter had nervous fever. It was fortunate for him that a doctor was
called in, and still more fortunate that it was a man who understood
Walter&rsquo;s mental troubles. He exerted a most wholesome influence
on the boy; though this came later, as at first he could only treat the
disease.</p>

<p>On Juffrouw Pieterse, too, he had a good influence. To her great
astonishment, he explained to her that children ought not to be packed
together in a bed as if they were superfluous pieces of furniture being
thrown aside; that air, light, play, enjoyment, exercise are all
necessary for the development of body and soul; that whipping does no
good, and that she had better dispense with her &ldquo;divine
worship.&rdquo; He told her of other things she had never heard of; and
she listened willingly, for the doctor&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, dear Juffrouw Laps, you must manage to be here when he
comes. He writes the prescriptions with a gold pen; and his coachman
wears a brown bear-skin cape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That gold pen and the bear-skin cape! Ah, if everyone who preaches
truth could only dress up his coachman so swell! But alas, alas&mdash;I
know a great many people who love the truth, and they have no coachman
at all&mdash;not to mention the bear-skin.</p>

<p>And gold pens often get into the wrong hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just wanted Juffrouw Zipperman to come sometime <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>when the
doctor&rsquo;s here. Run and tell her, Gertrude, that I said Walter was
sick, and say that we have lunch about twelve. He came about that time
yesterday. And Leentje, you go to the grocer&rsquo;s&mdash;we need
salt&mdash;have something to say about it&mdash;it&rsquo;s not just to
be gossiping, you know&mdash;I despise gossip&mdash;but I would like to
know if the people have noticed it. And you, Pietro, remember that you
are to give me a clean cap when he comes&mdash;for the doctor is such
an elegant gentleman, and such a doctor! And all that he said&mdash;I
drank it all in. Mina, you mustn&rsquo;t stare at him again like that;
it&rsquo;s not proper. But I&rsquo;m curious to know if the people at
the grocer&rsquo;s have seen him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t like to be severe on her; but it seems to me that
Juffrouw Pieterse was gradually beginning to take pleasure in
Walter&rsquo;s illness.</p>

<p>There is something swell in having such a carriage standing before
one&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps had come: &ldquo;But dear Juffrouw Pieterse, what am I
to do about my uncle? You are invited; and I have told him that there
will be a poem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very bad, Juffrouw Laps. You can see though that that poor
worm can&rsquo;t write the poem. What about Stoffel? Why not ask him to
write it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right with me. Just so it&rsquo;s a poem;
otherwise I&rsquo;m disgraced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel was requested to take Walter&rsquo;s place, but he raised
objections at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what that would mean, mother. I would
lose the respect of the boys. For anyone working with youth, respect is
the main thing; and such a poem&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121">121</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But the boys at school need not know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the man would tell somebody and then&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t understand it. At the Diaconate school there was a fellow
who wrote verses; and what has become of him? He went to India, mother,
and he still owes me for half a bottle of ink. That&rsquo;s the way it
goes, mother. For me to write such a poem? No, no, mother&mdash;for a
boy like Walter it&rsquo;s all right; but when one is already a
teacher!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Master Pennewip?&rdquo; cried Juffrouw Laps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very man!&rdquo; cried Stoffel, as if this supported his
former argument. &ldquo;A happy thought! Master Pennewip will do
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read a poem by him, Stoffel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. And you&rsquo;ve read a poem by him. That&rsquo;s
because&mdash;but how shall I explain that to you, Juffrouw Laps? You
know that in teaching there are all kinds of things. Take Geography,
for example. I will just mention one fact: Madrid is on the Manganares.
Understand, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Stoffel. That&rsquo;s just as if you were to
say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amsterdam on the Y. Exactly so. And then there are many, many
more things, Juffrouw Laps. You have no idea how much there is of it. A
grocer mixes sugar with something else. He must calculate exactly what
he must get for a pound in order not to lose money. Think of it! And
then you have partnership, and breakage, and the verbs&mdash;but I must
go before those rascals break everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel returned to school earlier than usual, without having
diminished Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s difficulties very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>much. That poor
woman could not comprehend how geography and Madrid and the grocer and
partnerships made it impossible for Stoffel to write verses. Juffrouw
Pieterse smoothed the matter over as well as she could and sent
Juffrouw Laps to Master Pennewip.</p>

<p>That gentleman was alarmed when he saw the angry &ldquo;sucking
animal,&rdquo; but he quieted down as soon as he heard the object of
her visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what class does your uncle belong, Juffrouw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, to the class&mdash;you mean the mussel-shells and
eggs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Juffrouw, I mean on which rung of the ladder is
he&mdash;how high up. I repeat it, on what rung&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
figure, Juffrouw&mdash;on what rung of the social ladder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the grain business? Is that what you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not sufficient, Juffrouw Laps. One may be in the
grain business as a pastry cook, a baker, a retailer, a wholesaler, or
as a broker; and all these vocations have their peculiar sub-divisions.
Take Joseph in Egypt, for example. This man of God, whom some place in
the class of patriarchs, while others claim&mdash;but let that be as it
may. It is certain that Joseph bought corn and was on the topmost rung
of the ladder, for we read in Genesis, chapter
41&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, he rode in Pharaoh&rsquo;s carriage, and he wore
a white silk coat. My uncle is an agent, and my father was the
same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So-o-oo? Agent! That&rsquo;s something Moses doesn&rsquo;t
mention, and I don&rsquo;t know in what class&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
spoke slowly, puzzling over his words. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb123" href="#pb123">123</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, my uncle is a widower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, there we have the difference! We read that Joseph wooed
Asnath, the daughter of Potiphar; but nowhere do we read that his
spouse was already dead when he went into the corn business. Therefore,
Juffrouw Laps, if it is your earnest desire to have a pious poem
written on your uncle, I advise you to go to my pupil, Klaasje van der
Gracht.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He explained to her where that prodigy might be found.</p>

<p>Again I must beg pardon if my criticism of Pennewip is too severe;
but he gave me reasons enough to harbor ugly suspicions against him. I
am convinced that he would have written that poem for Juffrouw Laps if
her uncle had received a white silk coat from the king, or had ever
driven through The Hague in a royal carriage. But to sing an agent in
verse! He would leave that to the genius of &ldquo;the flying
tea-kettle&rdquo; in the Peperstraat. That was not nice of Pennewip.
Was that uncle to blame because his brothers never threw him into a
well? or sold him into Egypt? Or because he couldn&rsquo;t interpret
dreams? Or because cleverness is not rewarded to-day with rings, white
coats, carriages and high official position?</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps footed it over to the Peperstraat, where she made the
acquaintance of the elder van der Gracht. The old gentleman felt
flattered.</p>

<p>He was most gracious, and assured the Juffrouw that the poem should
be written that very evening. Klaasje could bring it over the next
morning and repeat it to Juffrouw Laps, and if it were found worthy as
an expression of her feelings toward her uncle, then <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>Klaasje was to be
invited to be present on that evening. The father assured her that
Klaasje would wear a white stand-up collar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like Joseph,&rdquo; said the Juffrouw. &ldquo;Everything
is in the Bible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she got home she read the forty-first chapter of Genesis,
trying to find the relation of Klaasje&rsquo;s apotheosis to
Joseph&rsquo;s exaltation. That night she dreamed she had a mantle in
her hand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href=

<div id="ch16" class="div1"><span class="pagenum"> [<a href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XVI</h2>

<p>It was the afternoon of the day on which Juffrouw Laps sought out
Klaasje van der Gracht, and Walter was lying in bed, still weak but no
longer delirious. The doctor had ordered rest and quiet. The child
counted the flowers in the curtain, and, in his imagination tried to
arrange them in some other order. He allowed them to jump over one
another, or flow into one another. He saw in them faces, forms, armies,
clouds&mdash;and all were alive and moving. It was tiresome, but he
couldn&rsquo;t do anything else. If he turned his face toward the wall
it was still worse. The hieroglyphic scratches on the wall told him all
sorts of things that he didn&rsquo;t need to know and overwhelmed him
with unnecessary impressions. He closed his eyes; but still he found no
rest. It seemed to him as if he were being swept away to take part in
that entertainment that the night-wind gave the moon. Everything was
turning round and round, taking him along. He seized his head in both
hands, as if he would stop his imagination by main strength; but it was
useless. The curtains, the cords, the wall, the flowers, the dance, the
whirlwind that tore Femke away&mdash;his efforts to hold
her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The boy burst into tears. He knew that it was all imagination; he
knew that he was sick; he knew that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>chimneys don&rsquo;t dance, and
that girls are not blown to the moon; and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Weeping he called Femke&rsquo;s name softly, not loud enough to be
heard by the others, but loud enough to relieve his own depression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried suddenly. &ldquo;Does she
answer? Is that imagination, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Actually, Walter heard his name called, and it was Femke&rsquo;s
voice!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must know whether I&rsquo;m dreaming, or not,&rdquo; he
said, and straightened himself up in bed. &ldquo;That is a red flower,
that is a black one, I am Walter, Laurens is a printer&rsquo;s
apprentice&mdash;everything is all right; and I&rsquo;m not
dreaming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned out of bed and listened again, his mouth and eyes as wide
open as he could get them, as if the senses of taste and sight were
going to reinforce that of hearing.</p>

<p><span class="corr" id="xd0e2999" title="Not in source">
&ldquo;</span>O, God! Femke&rsquo;s voice! Yes, yes, it is
Femke!&rdquo; He jumped out of bed, ran out the door, and half ran,
half fell down the steps.</p>

<p>To return to Femke for a little while. She had expected Walter at
the bridge the next day after the story of the sun-worshipers. At first
she thought that Walter was waiting till he could borrow from Stoffel
the book with the picture showing Aztalpa embracing the two brothers.
She wanted to see Walter with the picture; now she would have been
satisfied with him without the picture. It couldn&rsquo;t be the
boy&rsquo;s person, she thought&mdash;such a child!&mdash;but he did
recite so well. Perhaps in the heart of the girl Walter and his
recitals had already coalesced. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127">127</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Put the clothes in the sun,&rdquo; cried her mother; and
Femke translated that:
Sun&mdash;Peru&mdash;Aztalpa&mdash;Kusco&mdash;Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run those fighters away; they&rsquo;ll throw dirt on the
clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Femke dreamed: Courageously fighting against the enemies of the
country&mdash;the noblest tribe of the
Incas&mdash;Telasco&mdash;Walter.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be calling for Walter; but he did not come.</p>

<p>The first day she was sad; the second, impatient; the third,
restless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;m going to see what&rsquo;s become of the
little boy who was going to write a poem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, my child!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;Do you think you
will find him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Femke nodded; but her nod was not convincing. She did not know where
Walter lived and was afraid to say so. It took courage to start out to
trace the child when she didn&rsquo;t know where he lived; and this
courage she wished to conceal. And why? Just timidity incident to the
tender feelings. Sometimes we conceal the good and boast of the
bad.</p>

<p>The girl dressed herself as prettily as she could and put all her
money in her pocket. It was only a few stivers. She hurried through Ash
Gate and inquired where the shop was that lent books. Thus she came
directly to the Hartenstraat. She simply retraced the steps of our
hero, when he made that first sally with Glorioso.</p>

<p>Less timid than Walter&mdash;Femke was older, and had had more
experience with men&mdash;she asked the gruff <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb128" href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>fellow in a business-like way
for &ldquo;the book about the countess with the long train or her
dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? What&rsquo;s the title?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Femke said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
about a robber&mdash;and the Pope&rsquo;s mentioned in it, too. I am
hunting for the boy who read the book. I wanted to ask where he
lives&mdash;I will pay you for your trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m a fool? Am I here to hunt for
boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, M&rsquo;neer, I will pay you,&rdquo; the girl said, and
laid the money on the counter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, get on! What do I know about your boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Femke got angry now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything, and you can&rsquo;t run me off
like that. No, you can&rsquo;t. If you don&rsquo;t want to tell me, you
needn&rsquo;t to. You are an unaccommodating fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was going to leave, when it occurred to her to ask, &ldquo;And
won&rsquo;t you lend me a book, either?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can get a book. What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That book about the robber and Amalia,&rdquo; said Femke. She
felt now that she was a &ldquo;customer,&rdquo; and oh, how proud she
had become all at once!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about such a book. Do you mean
Rinaldo Rinaldini?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Is there more than one robber book? Just call over the
names of them for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was said with an air of importance that was not without its
effect on the shopman. He pulled down the catalogue, and soon he came
to &ldquo;Glorioso.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Femke,
delighted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href=
"#pb129">129</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must deposit a forfeit,&rdquo; the man said, as he
mounted the ladder to get that precious book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, I don&rsquo;t want the book at all. I only want to
know where the boy lives who read it. I will pay you gladly,&rdquo; and
she pointed to her money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t necessary,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mind accommodating you when you ask me politely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked in the register and found the name Femke had mentioned,
with the address. He showed it to her, and was even going to explain to
her the best way to get there; but Femke was already out the door. The
fellow had difficulty in overtaking her to return the money she had
forgotten on the counter.</p>

<p>When she reached the address given, Femke learned that the Pieterses
had moved to a &ldquo;sweller <span class="corr" id="xd0e3066" title=
"Source: neighbourhood">neighborhood</span>.&rdquo; It was quite a
distance away; but Femke was not deterred by that.</p>

<p>Once at the Pieterses&rsquo;, she was received by the young ladies
with a rough, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Juffrouw, I wanted to ask about Walter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Femke, Juffrouw, and my mother is a wash-woman. I would
like to know if Walter is all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you got to do with Walter?&rdquo; asked Juffrouw
Pieterse, who had heard the commotion and <span class="corr" id=
"xd0e3079" title="Source: come">came</span> down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Juffrouw, don&rsquo;t be angry&mdash;I wanted to know;
and my mother knows that I&rsquo;ve come to ask. Walter told me about
Telasco, and the girl that was to die&mdash;oh, Juffrouw, tell me if
he&rsquo;s sick! I cannot sleep till I know.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130">130</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business. Go, I tell you! I
don&rsquo;t want strange people standing around the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, Juffrouw!&rdquo; cried the girl,
wringing her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s crazy. Put her out, Trudie, and slam the
door!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trudie began to execute the order. Myntje and Pietje got ready to
help her; but the child clung to the balustrade and held her
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw her out! The impudent thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Juffrouw, I&rsquo;m not impudent. I will go. Just tell me
whether Walter is sick. Tell me, and I will go right now. Just tell me
if he&rsquo;s sick&mdash;if, if he&rsquo;s going&mdash;to
die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor child began to weep. Anybody else but those Pieterse women
would have been touched at the sight. They were too far up the
ladder.</p>

<p>Plainer people, or nobler people would have understood Femke.
Feeling, sympathy, is like the money in a gambling-place. It
doesn&rsquo;t come to everybody. There wenches and countesses sit side
by side; merely respectable people, who sell shoes made in Paris, are
not there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; cried Femke. &ldquo;Oh, God! I
won&rsquo;t go! I will know whether that child is sick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A door was heard opening above; and Walter came in sight. He tumbled
down the steps and fell unconscious at Femke&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That boy!&rdquo; groaned the old lady, while the girls stood
as if transfixed. Femke picked Walter up and carried him upstairs. His
bed was pointed out to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href=

courage to run her away when she took a chair by the bedside. If at
this moment the rights of the Pieterses and Femke had been voted upon,
all the votes would have gone to Femke.</p>

<p>She wept, and stammered &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Juffrouw; but I
couldn&rsquo;t sleep for thinking of him.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XVII</h2>

<p>The evening of the birthday party came. All of the Pieterses went,
leaving Walter to be taken care of by Leentje.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps was doing the honors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A strange state of affairs,&rdquo; said the birthday uncle.
&ldquo;And what did she want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness, M&rsquo;neer, I don&rsquo;t know myself.
I&rsquo;ve told Gertrude a hundred times that it&rsquo;s too much for
me. Just imagine to yourself&mdash;such a thing issuing commands in my
house! I told Mina to pitch her out. And Pietro
said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have seen me get hold of her,&rdquo; croaked
that brave young woman, showing a blue place on her hand. From this it
might have been inferred that Femke had had hold of Pietro.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait till she comes again,&rdquo; cried Gertrude,
&ldquo;and I will attend to her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what will I do for her?&rdquo; said Mina
significantly.</p>

<p>Every one of them was ready for the fray. That is often the case. If
the vote had been taken now on moral worth, Femke would have been
defeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A common girl, M&rsquo;neer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse than common!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you get rid of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it wasn&rsquo;t easy. I said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133">133</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother, I said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it was I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each one of them had said something. Everyone wanted to play the
leading r&ocirc;le in the interesting drama.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to know where the young Mr. van der Gracht
is,&rdquo; said Juffrouw Laps. &ldquo;Yes, uncle, it&rsquo;s a
surprise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juffrouw Pieterse did not like to be interrupted when she had
something to tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so we said&mdash;what did we say, Gertrude?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, I said it was a disgrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I said so, too. Then that thing asked for cold water,
and when we didn&rsquo;t get it quick enough for her, she ran and
fetched it herself&mdash;just as if she were at home! She wet a cloth
and put it on Walter&rsquo;s head. I was amazed at her insolence. When
the child came to she gave him a kiss! Think of it&mdash;and all of us
standing there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried the three daughters, &ldquo;think of
it&mdash;and us standing there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she sat down in front of the bed again and talked to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where can the young Mr. van der Gracht be!&rdquo; sighed
Juffrouw Laps. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only because we have a little
surprise, uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And finally she went away like a princess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly like a princess,&rdquo; testified the girls; and they
did not know that they were telling the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she told Walter she would come again. But I just want to
see her do it!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134">134</a>]</span></p>

<p>The door-bell rang. Juffrouw Laps arose; and the catechist van der
Gracht with his son walked into the room. Juffrouw Pieterse
didn&rsquo;t like this; she felt that the star of her narration would
pale in the light of the poem Klaasje had brought with him. And even
without a poem: such dignity, such a carriage, such manners, such a
voice!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mynheer and Juffrouwen, may God bless you all this evening!
This is my son Klaas, of whom you have heard, I suppose. He&rsquo;s too
close kin to me for me to praise him; but you understand&mdash;when
it&rsquo;s the father&mdash;well, all blessings come from
above.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, uncle, it will be a surprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, Juffrouw, a beautiful surprise. I congratulate
this gentleman on the happy return of his natal day. It puts me in the
mood of the psalmist&mdash;and I thank God&mdash;for Mynheer,
everything comes from above, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a seat. I thank you,&rdquo; said the host, who
understood that he had been congratulated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold out,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little cool; hardly cold. It&rsquo;s just what we call
cool, you understand. The Master gives us weather as he sees fit; and
for that reason I say cool. Everything comes from above.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this last statement all assented in audible sighs and thought
themselves pious. What would have happened to him if some poor devil
had announced to them that some things come from below?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, uncle, what do you say? Shall we begin with the
surprise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, niece; what have you got?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135">135</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only a trifle, Mynheer,&rdquo; put in the
catechist. &ldquo;My son is a poet. I don&rsquo;t praise him, because
he&rsquo;s too close kin to me; but he&rsquo;s a clever fellow&mdash;I
can say that without bragging&mdash;for everything comes from above.
No, I won&rsquo;t praise him&mdash;praise is for the Master alone. But
he&rsquo;s a clever fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poet Klaas looked conscious, and sat toying with the bottom
button on his vest. He looked poetical all over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, Mynheer, without bragging&mdash;get it out, my son.
As a father, Mynheer, I may say that he&rsquo;s a clever fellow; for in
the Bible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaasje drew a piece of paper from his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Bible there is really nothing said about
widowers&mdash;the Master has his own good reasons for it&mdash;but
what does the boy do? He takes the hint and writes a whole poem on
widows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaasje laid the paper on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I dare say, he has brought into it all the widows
mentioned in the Bible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s a surprise. I told you so,&rdquo; said
Juffrouw Laps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read it, Klaasje! There are seventy, Mynheer, seventy widows.
Read, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaas pulled at his clothes, arranged his cuffs and began:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The widows that in the Bible appear,</p>

<p class="line">I&rsquo;ve brought together in this poem here,</p>

<p class="line">For the birthday that we celebrate</p>

<p class="line">Of him who sadly lost his mate,</p>

<p class="line">Exalting always the Master of Love,</p>

<p class="line">For all that we have comes from above.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the prologue,&rdquo; explained the father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the prologue. Now I will read:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Genesis, 38, verse 11, it is said:</p>

<p class="line">At her father-in-law&rsquo;s must the widow have her
bed.</p>

<p class="line">Exodus, 20, 22, it is penned:</p>

<p class="line">Widows and orphans thou shalt not offend.</p>

<p class="line">Two verses further he threatens, wrathful and grim</p>

<p class="line">To make widows of all the women that anger him.</p>

<p class="line">Leviticus, 21, verse 14, thou read&rsquo;st</p>

<p class="line">That a widow won&rsquo;t do for the wife of a
priest.</p>

<p class="line">A chapter further, one verse less, we have read,</p>

<p class="line">That a childless widow must eat her father&rsquo;s
bread.</p>

<p class="line">From Numbers, 30, verse 10, we clearly infer,</p>

<p class="line">That a widow&rsquo;s vow is sufficient for
her.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In this style he continued glibly, without any interruption; but
when he came to:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Second Samuel, 20, 3, very clearly outlines,</p>

<p class="line">That as widows must live David&rsquo;s
concubines&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Juffrouw Pieterse became restless and had to have an
explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Juffrouw, concubines,&rdquo; said van der Gracht senior.
&ldquo;You see the boy has brought in everything relating to
widows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The verses are not the same length,&rdquo; Stoffel
complained; and there is no alternation of masculine and feminine
lines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be right, Stoffel, for you are a school-teacher; but
that&rsquo;s immaterial to me. These&mdash;these con&mdash;what shall I
say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Juffrouw Pieterse, you ought not to mock at it,&rdquo; cried
Juffrouw Laps. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href=
"#pb137">137</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the catechist, &ldquo;all
blessings come from above. Go ahead, Klaas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will not hear such things&mdash;on account of my
daughters!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls were examining their finger nails, and looked
pre&euml;minently respectable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Klaas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had known that this was going to happen, I would have
left my daughters at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Juffrouw, it&rsquo;s in the Bible. You&rsquo;re not
opposed to the Bible, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I refuse to hear anything that isn&rsquo;t
respectable. My husband&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your husband sold shoes. I know it, Juffrouw, but
you&rsquo;re not going to turn against&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do anything against the Bible, but I
will not endure such coarseness. Come, Gertrude, come,
children!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juffrouw Pieterse was climbing the ladder of respectability. Moving
out of a side street into one of the principal avenues, giving the
children French names, calling in a doctor whose coachman wears
furs&mdash;that is what lifts us up. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XVIII</h2>

<p>Walter&rsquo;s illness now took a favorable turn. As soon as he was
strong enough to leave his bed, the whole family noticed that he had
grown. All remarked about it and called each other&rsquo;s attention to
it. No one was better convinced of the fact than Juffrouw Pieterse; for
&ldquo;that boy&rdquo; had &ldquo;outgrown all of his clothes,&rdquo;
and it would not be easy &ldquo;to fit him out respectably
again.&rdquo; So much interesting notoriety and respectability had been
reaped from Walter&rsquo;s illness that it was only natural that his
convalescence should be turned to the best account.</p>

<p>The child would sit and fill in the colors in pictures. The doctor
had presented him the pictures and a box of colors. The latter, so
Stoffel said, were the genuine English article.</p>

<p>Oh, such pictures!</p>

<p>Walter was interested especially by pictures from the opera and the
tragedy. There were pictures from Macbeth, Othello, Lear, Hamlet, from
&ldquo;The Magic Flute,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Barber of Seville,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz,&rdquo; and from still a few more&mdash;each
one always more romantic than the last. In selecting suitable colors
for his heroes and heroines, Walter had the advice of the entire
family, including Leentje. Usually there was disagreement, but that
only made the matter more important. In only two details were they
agreed: faces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=
"#pb139">139</a>]</span>and hands were to have flesh-color, and lips
were to be painted red. It had always been that way; otherwise, why was
it called flesh-color? On account of this arrangement Hamlet came off
rather badly, receiving a much more animated countenance than was
suited to his melancholy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew what the dolls mean,&rdquo; said Walter. He was
talking about his pictures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only necessary to ask Stoffel,&rdquo; his mother
replied. &ldquo;Wait till he comes from school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter asked him. Stoffel&mdash;there are more such people in the
world&mdash;would never admit that he did not know a thing; and he
always knew how to appear knowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the dolls mean? Well, you see&mdash;those are, so to
say, the pictures of various persons. There, for instance, the one with
a crown on his head&mdash;that is a king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you Stoffel could explain them,&rdquo; corroborated
his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I should have liked to know what king, and what he
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! There it is at the bottom. You can read it, can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Macbeth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. It&rsquo;s Macbeth, a famous king of ancient
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that one there with a sword in his hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Also a king, or a general, or a hero, or something of the
kind&mdash;somebody that wants to fight. Perhaps David, or Saul, or
Alexander the Great. That&rsquo;s not to be taken so exactly.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140">140</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And the lady with the flowers? She seems to be tearing them
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That one? Show her to me: Ophelia. Yes, that&rsquo;s Ophelia.
Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why does she throw the leaves on the ground?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? why? The questions you do ask!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the mother came to the rescue of her eldest son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Walter, you mustn&rsquo;t ask more questions than
anybody can answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter did not ask any more questions, but he determined to get to
the bottom of the matter at the first opportunity. His imagination
roamed over immeasurable domains&mdash;such an insatiate conqueror was
the little emperor Walter in his night-jacket!</p>

<p>He associated the heroes of his pictures with the doctor, who had
been so friendly to him, and with his immortal Glorioso. The Peruvian
story, too, furnished a few subjects for his empire. He married Telasco
to Juliet; and the priests of the sun got their rights again. Master
Pennewip received a new wig, but of gold-colored threads, on the model
of the straw crown of a certain King Lear. Persons that he could see
from the window were numbered among his subjects. He had to do
something; and this foreign material was preferable to that in his
immediate surroundings. Even Lady Macbeth, who was washing her hands
and not looking particularly pleasing, seemed to him to be of a higher
order than his mother or Juffrouw Laps. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb141" href="#pb141">141</a>]</span></p>

<p>In fact, for him those pictures were the greatest things in the
world. He was carried away with the crowns, diadems, plumes, iron
gratings over the faces, with the swords and the daggers with
cross-hilts to swear on&mdash;with the trains and puff-sleeves and
girdles with pendents of gold&mdash;and the pages. All this had nothing
in common with his everyday surroundings. How is it possible, he
thought, that anyone who has such beautiful pictures should sell them?
The doctor must have inherited them!</p>

<p>Even if he had known that Lady Macbeth was the personification of
crime, it would still have seemed to him a profanation to bring her
into contact with the plebeian commonness around him.</p>

<p>All at once something in Ophelia&rsquo;s form reminded him of Femke.
She too could stand that way, plucking the petals from the flowers and
strewing them on the ground.</p>

<p>He had dim recollections of what had happened, and occasionally he
would ask indifferently about &ldquo;that girl.&rdquo; He was afraid to
speak her name before Gertrude, Mina, and Pietro. He was always
answered in tones that showed him that there was no room for his
romance there; but he promised himself to visit her as soon as he got
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re better you must go to see the doctor and
thank him for curing you&mdash;but thank God first; and then you can
show him what you&rsquo;ve painted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, mother! I will give her the Prince of
Denmark&mdash;I mean him, the doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But be careful not to soil it; and don&rsquo;t forget that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>the
ghost of the old knight must be very pale. Stoffel said
so&mdash;because it&rsquo;s a ghost, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother, I&rsquo;ll make it white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. And you&rsquo;ll make the lady there yellow?&rdquo;
pointing with a knitting-needle to Ophelia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Walter quickly, &ldquo;she was
blue!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was? Who was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only mean that I have so much yellow already, and I wanted
to make her&mdash;this one&mdash;Ophelia&mdash;I wanted to make her
blue. That one washing her hands can stay yellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; the mother said,
&ldquo;but don&rsquo;t soil it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel, in the meantime, had got on the track of those pictures. He
was slick and had an inquiring mind. One of his colleagues at school,
who was in some way connected with the stage, told him that such
costume-pictures were of great value to players. He also told him other
things about these pictures and about the play in general.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for Walter that Stoffel brought this knowledge home
with him. Even to-day there are people who find something immoral in
the words &ldquo;Theatre&rdquo; and &ldquo;Player&rdquo;; but at that
time it was still worse. The satisfaction, however, of imparting
knowledge and appearing wise put Stoffel in an attitude of mind on this
occasion that ordinarily would have been irreconcilable with that
narrowness which with him took the place of conscience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, mother, there are comedies and comedies. Some are
sad, some funny. Some are all nonsense, and there&rsquo;s nothing to be
learned from them; but there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143">143</a>]</span>are comedies so sad that the people wail when
they see them&mdash;even respectable people!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and then there are others where there&rsquo;s music and
singing. They are nice, and moral too. They are called operas; and
people who are entirely respectable go there. You see, mother,
there&rsquo;s nothing bad about it; and we ought not to be so narrow.
The old Greeks had comedies, and our professors still study
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walter&rsquo;s pictures are from real comedies; but I
can&rsquo;t tell all the details now. I will only say there are good
comedies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must tell Juffrouw Laps. She always
says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what does she know about it? She never saw a comedy in
her life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the truth; but it was just as true of the Pieterse
family&mdash;with the exception of Leentje.</p>

<p>One afternoon Leentje had complained of a terrible headache and had
left off sewing and gone out. Later it was learned that she had not
spent the evening with her mother; and then there was a perfect storm.
But Leentje would not say where she had been that night. &ldquo;That
night&rdquo; was Juffrouw Pieterse&rsquo;s expression, though she knew
that the girl was at home by eleven o&rsquo;clock. Leentje betrayed
nothing. She had promised the dressmaker next door not to say anything;
for the dressmaker had to be very careful, because her husband was a
hypocrite.</p>

<p>In Leentje&rsquo;s work-box was found a mutilated program; <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>and then
one day she began to sing a song she had never sung
before&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m full of honor, I&rsquo;m full of honor;
oh, yes, I&rsquo;m a man of honor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then it was all out! She had been to the Elandstraat and had
seen the famous Ivan Gras in a comedy!</p>

<p>Leentje began to cry and was going to promise never to do so again,
when, to her amazement, she was told that there was nothing wrong in
it, and that even the greatest professors went to see comedies.</p>

<p>And now she must tell them about it.</p>

<p>It was &ldquo;The Child of Love,&rdquo; <span class="corr" id=
"xd0e3409" title="Source: By">by</span> Kotzebue, that had greeted her
astonished eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was music, Juffrouw, and they played beautifully; and
then the curtain went up, and there was a great forest, and a woman
wept under a tree. There was a Baron who made her son a prisoner,
because he was a hunter&mdash;but he spoke so nice, and his mother,
too. The Baron said he was master on his place, and that he would
punish such thieves. He was in a great rage. And then the mother
said&mdash;no, somebody else came and said&mdash;but then the curtain
went down. The dressmaker bought waffles that were being passed around,
and we drank chocolate. The dressmaker said that every day wasn&rsquo;t
a feast day. A man sat behind us and explained everything and took our
cups when they were empty. Then the band played, &lsquo;Pretty girls
and pretty flowers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; cried the three young ladies. For it was a
common street song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then the curtain went up again of its own <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>accord; but the
gentleman behind us said somebody raised it&mdash;perhaps the
&lsquo;Child of Love&rsquo; himself, for he was not in prison when the
curtain was down. The dressmaker gave him a peppermint-drop, and he
said: &lsquo;Watch the stage, Juffrouw, for you have paid to see
it.&rsquo; It cost twelve stivers, without the waffles and chocolate.
Then the Baron said&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t tell it all exactly as it
was. I will only say that the old woman wept all the time, and she
could not be reconciled, because she was so unhappy. You see, Juffrouw,
the child of love was her own child; and it was also the Baron&rsquo;s
child of love. That was bad&mdash;because it was just a child of love,
you see; and that is always bad. He had no papers, no credentials; nor
the mother, either. And he was to die because he had hunted. Oh, it was
beautiful, Juffrouw! And then the curtain went down again and we ate
another waffle. The gentleman behind us said it was well that they gave
plays with prison scenes in them. There were so many bad people in the
hall, such as pickpockets and the like, and this would be a warning for
them. The dressmaker was going to offer him another mint-drop, when she
saw that her box was gone. It was silver. The gentleman said of course
some pickpocket had taken it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was the pickpocket!&rdquo; exclaimed several.</p>

<p>Leentje was indignant at the idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! Don&rsquo;t say that; it&rsquo;s a sin. He was a very
respectable gentleman, and addressed me as Juffrouw, just as he did the
dressmaker. He tried to find the thief. He asked where the Juffrouw
lived, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href=
"#pb146">146</a>]</span>and said that if he found the box he would
bring it to her. He wore a fancy vest&mdash;no, no, no. Don&rsquo;t say
that of him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, tell some more about the child of love.&rdquo; All were
interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the music was so nice! And a gentleman showed them with a
stick how to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But tell us about the comedy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not so easy. It was very beautiful. It must be seen;
it can&rsquo;t be told. The Baron saw that the hunter in prison was his
own son; because a long time before, you see, that is&mdash;formerly,
he had been acquainted with&mdash;you
understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Leentje turned as red as fire, and left her audience in a
temporary suspense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he had <span class="corr" id="xd0e3440" title="Source:
know">known</span> the old woman formerly, and then they were good
friends, and were often together&mdash;I will just tell it that
way&mdash;and they were to marry, but something came between them; and
so&mdash;and&mdash;for that reason the comedy was called the
&lsquo;Child of Love.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter listened with as much interest as the others; but he was less
affected than the girls, who sat quietly staring into space. Stoffel
felt called upon to say something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! He abused her chastity&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the way it&rsquo;s spoken of&mdash;and she was left to bear the
disgrace. The youth of to-day cannot be warned enough against this. How
often have I told the boys at school!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Walter, and pay attention to what Stoffel
says!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147">147</a>]</span></p>

<p>Encouraged by the approval of his mother, Stoffel continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother, virtue must be revered. That is God&rsquo;s
will; and what God does is well done. Of all sins sensual pleasure
is&mdash;a very great sin, because it is forbidden; and because all
sins are punished, either in this world or in the next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hear, Walter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, or in the next world, mother! Innocent pleasure, yes;
but sensual pleasure&mdash;it is forbidden! It loosens all the ties of
human society. You see that such a comedy can be very fine. Only you
must understand it properly&mdash;that&rsquo;s the idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did the Baron do then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Juffrouw, what shall I say! He talked a whole lot to the
old woman, and was very sad because he had&mdash;away back
there&mdash;because he had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seduced her,&rdquo; added Stoffel, seeing that Leentje
couldn&rsquo;t find the word. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s
called.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what she said, too; and he promised never
to do it again. And then he told the child of love always to follow the
path of virtue, and that he would marry the old woman. She was
satisfied with the arrangement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; cried the three girls in a breath.
&ldquo;She will be a rich baroness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Leentje, &ldquo;she became a great lady. And
then the child of love fell on the Baron&rsquo;s neck; and they played
&lsquo;Bridal Wreath.&rsquo; The &lsquo;Child of Love&rsquo; became a
hussar and sang, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m full of honor, I&rsquo;m full of
honor; Oh, I&rsquo;m a man of honor!&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb148" href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>I don&rsquo;t know what became
of the old Baron. And then we went home; but the dressmaker took no
more pleasure in the play now, because her silver box was gone. I
don&rsquo;t know whether the gentleman ever brought it to her, or
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The play was out.</p>

<p>The girls thought: &ldquo;Baroness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel was thinking: &ldquo;Virtue!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother&rsquo;s thoughts ran: &ldquo;Twelve stivers for a ticket,
and waffles and chocolate extra!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was saying to himself: &ldquo;A hunter! A whole year in the
forest, in the great forest, and alone. I&rsquo;d like to do it,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took up his brush and looked at Ophelia: &ldquo;To be alone in
the great forest with&mdash;Femke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the theatre question was far from being settled. Leentje had to
clear up many doubtful points yet. For instance, Pietro wanted to know
how old the woman was when the Baron finally married her. Leentje
thought she must have been about sixty.</p>

<p>Also Juffrouw Laps had to express her opinion. She declared that she
was opposed to everything &ldquo;worldly,&rdquo; and insisted that
Walter be sent to church.</p>

<p>Later she got into a big dispute over the theatre with Master
Pennewip, whom Stoffel had brought in to reinforce his position. He had
brought with him &ldquo;Floris the Fifth,&rdquo; that powerful comedy
by the noble <span class="corr" id="xd0e3490" title="Source:
Bilderdijk">Bilderdyk</span>. With many declensions and conjugations
and remarks on rhyme and metre, he explained, firstly, that
&ldquo;Floris the Fifth&rdquo; was a play from which much <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>could be learned;
and, secondly, that the theatre was something very moral and thoroughly
respectable.</p>

<p>To be sure, he failed to convince Juffrouw Laps. Nor was Walter
greatly impressed by that masterpiece, despite the fact that there were
three deaths in it. He much preferred the beautiful story of Glorioso,
or the Peruvian story&mdash;or even Little Red <span class="corr" id=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XIX</h2>

<p>Walter had been to church: that was now behind him. Stoffel thought
the pastor had preached a beautiful sermon, and said that &ldquo;in a
way all he said could be accepted.&rdquo; He hoped that it would
&ldquo;bear fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;and he mustn&rsquo;t tear
his new breeches again. They cost too much hard work for
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the &ldquo;hard work&rdquo; done in the Pieterse
family might be regarded as a negligible quantity. There was the
necessary housework, and the usual complaining&mdash;or boasting, if
you will&mdash;but this was to be expected.</p>

<p>That Walter had postponed his visit to go to church was a result of
the frightful threats of Juffrouw Laps. She cited Second Chronicles
xvi. 12, and in the face of this text the Pieterses were not able
successfully to defend their new and more liberal position. Juffrouw
Pieterse could only say that the Bible was not to be interpreted that
way, as if everything in it applied to a given individual.</p>

<p>But Juffrouw Laps stuck to it, that if one has faith and grace one
may come through all right; whereupon Juffrouw Pieterse expressed her
willingness at all times to take advice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are the essential things; through them we are saved!
And&mdash;send him to me the first of the week. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>Or he can come Sunday, but
after church. Then he can tell me about the sermon, even if the pastors
are&mdash;but what does a child know about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps didn&rsquo;t think much of pastors. She held that
people with grace in their hearts can understand God&rsquo;s word
without Greek and Latin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sunday after church. I will count upon it.&rdquo; And in
order to make her invitation more insistent she mentioned certain
sweets that she usually served her guests at that time.</p>

<p>Supposing that Juffrouw Laps was really anxious for Walter to come,
we must admit that she showed deep knowledge of boy-nature.</p>

<p>As for Walter, he was afraid to be alone with this pious lady. For
him she was the living embodiment of all the plagues that are made use
of in the Old Testament to convert rebellious tribes to the true faith.
For instance, thunder and lightning, pestilence, abysses, boils,
flaming swords, etc.</p>

<p>If he had had the courage he would have asked her just to deposit
the promised dainties somewhere outside of her flat. He would find them
then. But he didn&rsquo;t have the courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why didn&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo; asked the mother when
Stoffel&rsquo;s enthusiasm over the sermon had begun to die down.</p>

<p>Walter said he had a pain in his stomach, which children always have
when they want to bridge over disagreeable duties. With a better
understanding between the parents and children this disease would be
less frequent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you have any pain in your
stomach,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href=
"#pb152">152</a>]</span>declared the mother. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
because you&rsquo;re a bad child and never do what you&rsquo;re told to
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel agreed with her; and then a council of war was held. Walter
was condemned to go to Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s at once; and he went.</p>

<p>Expecting some terrible ordeal, he was greatly embarrassed and
confused by the show of friendliness with which he was received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you did come, my dear boy! But you are so late! Church
has been out a long time. See what I have for you, expressly for <i>
you</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thrust him into a chair at the table and shoved all sorts of
sweets over to him. Walter&rsquo;s embarrassment increased; and he felt
even less at ease when she began to stroke him and call him pet
names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, tell me about the sermon,&rdquo; she said, when the
child tried to escape the tenderness and affection to which he was not
accustomed. &ldquo;What did the pastor say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The text&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all right&mdash;afterwards, when your mouth
is empty. You must eat a few cakes first. Nobody can do everything at
once. There is chocolate; and you&rsquo;re to have a little dram, too.
I&rsquo;ve always said that you are a nice boy; but they&rsquo;re
forever plaguing you so. But you&rsquo;re not eating enough; do just as
if you were at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Walter that was not the right expression. At home!</p>

<p>His first surprise over Walter began to be possessed by a feeling of
fear. Why, he could not have told to save him. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153">153</a>]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly he got up and declared that his mother had told him not to
stay long.</p>

<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a word of truth in it. Juffrouw Laps protested,
but Walter held his ground. Despite all of that kindness Walter was
able to escape from the enemy.</p>

<p>Promising &ldquo;to come back soon&rdquo; he ran down the steps and
into the street.</p>

<p>An indescribable feeling of freedom regained thrilled through him.
He had escaped. It was incomprehensible even to him. Never had he been
received so kindly, so cordially; never had he been treated in a manner
approaching this. But why his antipathy? When he left she was going to
kiss him, but he managed to dodge her. Why? He didn&rsquo;t know. But
it made him shudder to think of it.</p>

<p>Should he go home now? What excuse could he give for coming back so
soon?</p>

<p>Involuntarily he bent his steps toward Ash Gate. It was not his
intention to visit Femke&mdash;not at all, really not! For he
didn&rsquo;t have his Ophelia with him&mdash;proof conclusive that when
he left home he had not thought of Femke.</p>

<p>And when he came in sight of his mills on the Buitensingel&mdash;oh,
they were silent! Was there no wind? Or were they observing Sunday?</p>

<p>The Buitensingel was full of people taking a Sunday stroll. Walter
followed the small stream, which led him towards Femke&rsquo;s house.
Soon he stood before the low enclosure; but he did not dare to go in.
Why? He put the blame on the absent Ophelia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I only had that picture here I&rsquo;d certainly go
in!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href=
"#pb154">154</a>]</span></p>

<p>That is questionable. Even with the picture he would have probably
been just as shy. He didn&rsquo;t know what he ought to say&mdash;or,
better, whether he could say anything, or not. He reflected. Suppose
Femke&rsquo;s mother should ask, &ldquo;Did you want
anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We&mdash;yes, the &ldquo;gentle reader&rdquo; and I&mdash;we should
have known what to answer. I wonder if our wisdom would have been wiser
than the stupidity of the child, who stood irresolute and hesitating
before the fence?</p>

<p>He stood staring at the house, his mouth wide open. His knees
trembled, his heart fluttered, his tongue was dry.</p>

<p>A small column of smoke curling up from the chimney aroused him.
What if a fire should break out! Then he would have to go in. He would
rescue her, and carry her away in his arms&mdash;far, far away&mdash;to
the end of the world, or at least outside of the town! Just anywhere
where the people wear red velvet and green silk, where the gentlemen
carry big swords and the ladies wear long trains. They would be so
becoming to Femke. And she should ride horseback, and he would follow
her&mdash;no, he would ride by her side, with a falcon on his hand!</p>

<p>If a fire should break out!</p>

<p>But Walter saw that the house was in no danger. This smoke came from
the kitchen. He noticed other houses in the neighborhood where cooking
seemed to be going on, and everywhere the chimneys were bearing witness
to activities below which were presumably similar to those of
Femke.</p>

<p>Finally a crowd of fellows came along who had <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>evidently been stopping at
one of those establishments where &ldquo;refreshments&rdquo; are
served. They had been greatly refreshed, and in their exuberance of
freshness, so to say, they crowded Walter away from the fence and took
him along with them for a little way.</p>

<p>He was easily reconciled to this; for why, he thought, should he
stand there and watch the smoke? There wasn&rsquo;t going to be any
fire; and then he didn&rsquo;t have Ophelia with him.</p>

<p>But to-morrow! To-morrow he would bring that picture with him! And
then he wouldn&rsquo;t stand at the fence like a baby.</p>

<p>He felt ashamed when he thought of his friends in their gay colors,
or in armor, with plumes and swords. Those kings and knights and
pages&mdash;they had been courageous, otherwise they never would have
received such high orders and distinctions. Unless there were some
change, he felt that he would never be pictured like that.</p>

<p>However, he expected that such a change would come&mdash;without
doubt, surely, certainly, truly! The further he went, the more
determined he became to go in the next day and put on a bold front and
say: &ldquo;Good-day, Juffrouw, how do you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was more difficult for him to decide what he would say to
Femke.</p>

<p>He made up various little speeches in the manner of Floris the
Fifth. In case Femke shouldn&rsquo;t like them he was going to say,
&ldquo;Why, that is from our greatest poet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he would ask her to explain a lot of mysterious <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>words in
Floris that he hadn&rsquo;t understood&mdash;for instance, &ldquo;fast
fellow,&rdquo; &ldquo;coverture,&rdquo; &ldquo;chastity,&rdquo; and
others.</p>

<p>Walter&rsquo;s development was determined by his desire to know
things. His feeling for Femke, which was hardly real love, was
subordinated to his thirst for knowledge. He knew that he
couldn&rsquo;t get much from her, especially book-learning; but it was
a pleasure merely to discuss things with her, even if she knew nothing
about them.</p>

<p>He was curious to know all that she might have to tell him, or to
ask him; for no doubt she too had been saving up her impressions for
her first friend. But, alas! he was not so certain of her friendship!
True, when he was sick she had asked about him; but perhaps she was
just passing by, and thought how easy it would be to ring the bell and
ask, &ldquo;How is Walter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still it had taken courage to do it. What would Mungo Park have said
if he had seen him hesitating before the gate! Walter knew that
wasn&rsquo;t the way to conquer the world.</p>

<p>And if anybody had asked Mungo Park: &ldquo;What do you want in
Africa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, he would have answered. Such a traveller in such a book is
never embarrassed.</p>

<p>Then Walter began to address all sorts of remarks to negro kings
that he had conquered with lance and sword. All the women kissed his
hand as he rode by on his bay, with fiery red caparison. He inquired
patronizingly after those good girls who had nursed him in his illness,
&ldquo;because the strange white man was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb157" href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>far from mother and sisters and
had no home.&rdquo; He would reward them princely.</p>

<p>In all this conquered land Walter was king and Femke
was&mdash;queen! How magnificent the big red velvet cloak would look on
her&mdash;and the gold crown!</p>

<p>Conquering continents was easy. He was scarcely thirteen; and yet he
was afraid that somebody might get ahead of him while he was being
detained by the treacherous Pennewip with declensions and conjugations.
And, then there were still more things to learn before one could be
king, even of a small country. Pocket-change would have to be increased
too, for, with all possible economy, six doits a week were
insufficient. The Hallemans&mdash;well, they had more; but fortunately
they were not thinking of Africa. For the present he was not afraid of
any competition from that quarter; but other children, nearer the
&ldquo;grown-up&rdquo; stage, might get the idea in their heads! And
then, what would he do to keep his mother from guessing when he made
his trips into the &ldquo;interior&rdquo; longer, and stayed out later
than was allowed by the regulations of the Pieterse household?</p>

<p>It was a difficult matter, but he would manage it.</p>

<p>All that might happen to him and Femke in Africa would be read
afterwards in pretty little books with colored pictures. He already saw
himself sitting on a throne, and Femke by his side. She was not proud;
she was willing for everybody to know&mdash;all those kneeling before
her&mdash;that she had been a poor wash-girl. She had become queen
because Walter had loved her; and now they needn&rsquo;t kneel any
more. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href=
"#pb158">158</a>]</span></p>

<p>On special occasions&mdash;well, of course, that was different; for
instance, when his mother and Stoffel came to visit him. They should
see how all the people honored him&mdash;and Femke whom they had
treated so badly. But once would be enough; then he would forgive them
everything and build them a big house with water-barrels and wash-tubs.
For Pennewip he would build a big schoolhouse, with desks and
ink-bottles and copy-books and wall maps of Europe and tables of the
new weights and measures. Then the old master could give instruction
from early in the morning till late at night&mdash;or even all
night.</p>

<p>He was just puzzling over how he was going to reconcile Master
Pennewip and the dusky young African to one another when Leentje opened
the door.</p>

<p>Without noticing it he had got home and rung the door-bell.
Unsuspectingly he fell into an environment quite different from that in
which he had moved for the last half hour. He scarcely understood what
his mother meant when she asked him how the visit turned out, and
whether Juffrouw Laps was satisfied with his report on the sermon.</p>

<p>Sermon? Laps? He was unprepared for such an examination. He
stammered out a sort of miscellaneous and irrelevant jumble of words,
but fortunately containing nothing about Africa.</p>

<p>It now developed that in the meantime there had been a sudden change
in certain details of religious belief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, mother?&rdquo; said Stoffel. &ldquo;Just as
I&rsquo;ve always said, it would take a lawyer to explain anything to
suit her. She always knows better&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; answered the mother.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s cracked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href=
"#pb159">159</a>]</span>or crazy. Now, just tell me, Stoffel, if anyone
can expect such a child to remember everything a preacher says. I
can&rsquo;t do it myself; and you can&rsquo;t do it, either. Master
Pennewip can&rsquo;t do it. I tell you, nobody can do it. And to
require that of such a child! She just wants to play the professor;
that&rsquo;s the reason she does it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel was of the same opinion. Encouraged by his sympathy the
mother became eloquent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to know what she&rsquo;s thinking about; or if
she thinks she&rsquo;s a pastor. With all her biblical quotations! And
then to torment a child hardly out of a sick bed&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
disgrace. You don&rsquo;t need to go to her. What business have you got
with her? I tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here it occurred to her that she herself had compelled Walter to go,
and she interrupted this line of thought to scold Walter and tell him
to get out of his Sunday breeches. Her dissatisfaction with herself
expressed itself further in a funeral oration on Walter&rsquo;s last
suit, which had cost so much &ldquo;hard work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then to let that child sit there for an hour without
anything to eat or drink! She would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter&rsquo;s feeling for justice couldn&rsquo;t let that pass. He
assured them that on the contrary&mdash;and then that excessive
kindness got in his way again. In his confusion he went into all the
details of the chocolate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! Why didn&rsquo;t you say so at once? But it&rsquo;s all
the same. I was going to add that she ought to have given you something
to eat. That&rsquo;s the way such folks are&mdash;always grumbling
about others and they won&rsquo;t see themselves. I believe in grace
too, and when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160">160</a>]</span>I have my housework done I like to hear the
Scripture read&mdash;but to be everlastingly and eternally prating
about it? No, that isn&rsquo;t religion. What do you say, Stoffel? One
must work part of the time. Walter! aren&rsquo;t you going to pull off
those new breeches? I&rsquo;ve told him a dozen times. Trudie, give him
his old ones!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter changed his breeches; but he promised himself that in Africa
he would wear Sunday breeches every day. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XX</h2>

<p>The next day Walter rang the doctor&rsquo;s door-bell. His heart was
in a flutter, for the doctor lived in an imposing house. He was
admitted and, after he had been announced, was told just to come
upstairs.</p>

<p>The maid conducted Walter to the &ldquo;study,&rdquo; where the
doctor was busy performing one of his paternal duties: he was teaching
his children.</p>

<p>There were three. A boy, somewhat older than Walter, sat alone in
one corner writing at a small table. The other two, a boy of
Walter&rsquo;s age and a girl that seemed to be a few years younger,
stood before the table behind which the doctor was sitting. On the
table stood a large globe, evidently the subject of discussion. This
became clear to Walter later, for, as far as he knew, he had never seen
such a large ball. He didn&rsquo;t know that there was any other way to
explain the location of countries except by means of maps. Thus he
noticed in the room all sorts of things that he didn&rsquo;t understand
till later.</p>

<p>When the maid opened the door of the room he heard the voices of the
children, and also that of the father. He even heard laughter; but when
he walked in all became as still as death. The two children at the
table stood like soldiers. There was something so comical in their
attitude that Walter could have laughed at them if he hadn&rsquo;t been
so embarrassed. Even the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href=
"#pb162">162</a>]</span>girl had a touch of official earnestness in her
face more striking than he had seen it in older people, even at church.
While the doctor was welcoming Walter and offering him a chair, the boy
stood with hands clapped down on the seams of his trousers as if he
expected someone to say, &ldquo;Right about&mdash;face!&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;Forward, column right, march!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The larger boy in the corner had only looked up once, but with that
peculiarly hostile expression which distinguishes man from other
animals&mdash;to the disadvantage of the former. It is noticeable
especially in children&mdash;sometimes in women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you, my boy. It was nice of you to
come. What have you there?&rdquo;&mdash;then he turned to the little
soldiers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remind me afterward to tell you at dinner something about
Olivier van Noort. William, you can think of it, can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter squinted at his Lady Macbeth, and was so embarrassed that he
was helpless to present it to the doctor. The room was so magnificent;
and the furnishings&mdash;the big cases full of books! His picture
seemed so common and ugly that, if he could have done so, he would have
swallowed it.</p>

<p>At home they had taught him how he must stand and sit and speak; and
now he stood there, as awkward as a cow, stammering and stuttering.
Making a supreme effort he managed to get it out that he had
&ldquo;come to thank the doctor&rdquo; for his
recovery&mdash;&ldquo;but God first&rdquo;!</p>

<p>The two soldiers bit their lips; and even the doctor found it
difficult to keep a straight face. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163"
href="#pb163">163</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;God first! Well said, my boy. Have you already thanked
God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, M&rsquo;nheer, every evening in bed, and yesterday at
church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Sietske unable to control herself any longer had to laugh
outright. Her laughter threatened to become contagious. William was
busier than usual with his nose; Hermann had come to life and was
eyeing Walter slyly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Order!&rdquo; thundered the doctor, giving the table a rap
with a ruler that made the globe tremble. Walter was frightened.
&ldquo;Order! This is a nice caper during study-hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clock began to strike. Sietske seemed to be counting, for at
every stroke she raised a finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;All my fingers&mdash;just
look, five! Five o&rsquo;clock, papa&mdash;Tyrant! Hurrah,
hurrah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both boys joined in the uproar. It was a quodlibet from
&ldquo;Gaudeamus igitur,&rdquo; &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Vive la
joie</span>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;God save the king.&rdquo; Forward, all!
<span lang="fr">Vive la vacance! A bas les tyrans!</span> Revenge! * *
* *</p>

<p>The children were determined to have their well earned romp; and
they had it. Walter rubbed his eyes, and would not believe his ears. It
was beyond his comprehension. * * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do now,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Come, mamma
is waiting dinner&mdash;and you, too, my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>William took Sietske on his back and Hermann mounted the father.
Thus they descended the stairs, Walter bringing up the rear. Lady
Macbeth had disappeared, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href=
"#pb164">164</a>]</span>being now crumpled up in Walter&rsquo;s
breast-pocket.</p>

<p>Walter was nonplussed. Was this the same man who used the gold
pen?&mdash;whose coachman wore the furs?</p>

<p>How was it possible? Was it a dream, that he and all the family had
looked on this man and simply been overcome by his dignity?</p>

<p>He couldn&rsquo;t understand it.</p>

<p>Again the atmosphere of the dining-room was quite different from
that of the schoolroom, either before or directly after five.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Present the young gentleman to your mamma,&rdquo; said the
doctor, turning to William.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I do it?&rdquo; asked Sietske.</p>

<p>Doctor Holsma nodded, and the little girl took Walter by the hand
and conducted him to a lady who sat at the head of the table preparing
the salad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, this is a young gentleman&mdash;oh, I must know your
name. What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walter Pieterse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Walter Pieterse, who has come to thank papa,
because he&mdash;he was sick; and he&mdash;the young gentleman is going
to stay for dinner, papa?&rdquo;&mdash;the doctor nodded
again&mdash;&ldquo;and he&rsquo;s going to stay for dinner,
mamma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With mamma&rsquo;s consent,&rdquo; said the father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, with mamma&rsquo;s consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mevrouw Holsma spoke to Walter kindly and offered him a chair. It
was necessary, too.</p>

<p>Everything seemed so princely to Walter that he was glad to be
seated. Three-fourths of his little figure <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb165" href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>was hidden under the table.
That was something gained. He was amazed at almost everything he saw
and heard. He folded his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to say a grace, little man?&rdquo; asked the
doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, M&rsquo;nheer,&rdquo; Walter stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good custom. Do you always do that at the table?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, always&mdash;at warm meals, M&rsquo;nheer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those children had been taught good manners. Nobody smiled.</p>

<p>Walter bowed his head for a moment; and the doctor took advantage of
the opportunity to give the children a look of warning. They
remembered; and, if afterwards Walter discovered that he had cut a
singular figure in this household, they were not to blame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do well to do it,&rdquo; said Holsma. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t do it; and perhaps we do well not to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;Everyone must act
according to his own conviction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This simple statement moved Walter more than any of them could have
imagined. He&mdash;a conviction! That short sentence of Mevrouw Holsma
attributed to him a dignity and importance that was strange to him, and
gave him a right he had never thought of before. Through the soup he
was thinking continually: &ldquo;I may have a conviction!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It never occurred to him that a thing could be interpreted otherwise
than it was interpreted for him by his mother or Stoffel, or some other
grown-up person. The whole question of praying, or not praying, did not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166">166</a>]</span>appear so important to him as this new fact,
that he could have a conviction. His heart swelled.</p>

<p>The doctor, who understood Walter, recalled him from his
thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone must act according to his conviction; and in order
to come to a conviction one has to reflect a long time over the matter.
I am convinced that our little guest would like to eat some of those
peas. Pass them to him, Sietske.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter had grasped the import of Holsma&rsquo;s words, and also the
meaning of this transition to the peas. Walter felt&mdash;without
putting his feelings into words&mdash;that the pedantry of the
schoolroom had been put aside at five o&rsquo;clock, and that his host
merely wanted to give him a friendly warning against dogmatic bigotry,
without tainting the fresh, wholesome atmosphere of the
dining-room.</p>

<p>Despite his shy, retiring nature&mdash;or, better, in connection
with this characteristic&mdash;Walter was an extremely intelligent boy.
This fact had escaped almost everybody he had come in contact with
because of his lack of self-confidence, which prevented him from
revealing his true self. He usually seemed to comprehend more slowly
than others; but this was because he was less easily satisfied with the
result of his thinking. His mind was exacting of knowledge. During
Walter&rsquo;s sickness Holsma had remarked this peculiarity of the
boy, and his interest had been enlisted at once.</p>

<p>Walter&rsquo;s shyness was due in a great measure to the manner in
which he had been taught what little he knew. Everything his teachers
taught him was looked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href=
"#pb167">167</a>]</span>upon by them as something immutable and
irrefutable. Twice two is four, Prince so-and-so is a hero, good
children go to heaven, God is great, the Reform Church represents the
true faith, etc., etc. It was never hinted to him that there was any
room for doubt. Indeed, he was led to believe that his desire to know
more about things was improper and even sinful.</p>

<p>After all those extraordinary occurrences in the study, Walter was
prepared to expect almost anything in the way of the unusual, but that
William and Hermann, and even little Sietske, were allowed to help
their plates to whatever they wanted&mdash;that was more wonderful to
him than the a&euml;rial voyage of Elias. With Genevi&egrave;ve in the
famous wilderness&mdash;yes, even in Africa it couldn&rsquo;t be any
more free and easy. He was continually surprised and taken off his
guard by the unwonted and unexpected. In fact, his thoughts were so far
away that when during dessert the little girl passed him a saucer of
cream&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ye gods, it happened and&mdash;I must tell it. Oh, if like the
chroniclers of old, I might put the blame on some privy councilor,
&ldquo;who unfortunately advised,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>But what privy councilor in the whole world could have advised
Walter to let that porcelain spoon tilt over the edge of the saucer and
fall into Sietske&rsquo;s lap! He did it, he!</p>

<p>Oh, how sad it was. He had just begun to pull himself up in his
chair. Another moment and he would have actually been sitting. Perhaps
he might have said something soon. The name of a certain country in
Africa, which Sietske could not remember a moment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>before, had
occurred to him. It was not that he might seem smarter than Sietske
that he was going to speak out. No, it was only that he might seem a
little less stupid than himself. But now&mdash;that miserable
spoon!</p>

<p>Before he had time to wonder how his awkwardness would be received,
Sietske was talking along smoothly about something else&mdash;just as
if this little &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; was a matter of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa, you were going to tell us something about Olivier van
Noort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She arose, wiped off her little skirt and fetched Walter another
spoon from the buffet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa, Olivier van Noort! You promised it,
papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All urged him to tell the story. Even Mevrouw Holsma manifested
great interest in it. Walter was aware that this conversation was
intended to cover up his accident. He was moved; for he was not
accustomed to anything like this. As Sietske took her seat again she
noticed a tear creeping down across his cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, I got a silver spoon. That&rsquo;s just as good,
isn&rsquo;t it? These porcelain things are so heavy and awkward.
They&rsquo;ve fallen out of my hand three times; and Hermann
can&rsquo;t manage them, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother nodded to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how it is with Olivier van Noort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door-bell rang, and almost immediately afterwards a gentleman
entered the room who was greeted by the children as Uncle Sybrand.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169">169</a>]</span></p>

<p>The host now invited all to the garden and sent Hermann to the study
for a book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You young rascal, don&rsquo;t you go now and maliciously
break that globe. It can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came the story of Admiral Olivier van Noort and the poor
Vice-Admiral Jan Claesz van Ilpendam, who was put ashore in the Strait
of Magellan for insubordination. It interested all, and called forth a
lively discussion, in which the entire family as well as the guests
took part. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXI</h2>

<p>To readers of a certain class of fiction it will no doubt seem
strange if I say that Walter&rsquo;s visit to the Holsma family
influenced greatly his spiritual development. Not immediately; but a
seed had been planted which was to grow later. He saw now that after
all independent thought was possible, even if he could not yet allow
himself that luxury. The mere knowledge that there were other opinions
in the world than those of his daily mentors was a long stride
forward.</p>

<p>He was depressed on account of his lack of knowledge. Those children
knew so much more than he did; and this made him sad.</p>

<p>They had spoken of someone who was startled to find footprints. Who
was it? The child had never heard of Defoe&rsquo;s hermit. He asked
Stoffel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Footprints? Footprints? Well, you must tell me what
footprints you mean&mdash;whose footprints. You must give names when
you ask questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;when you
want to know anything you must mention names. And Mevrouw made the
salad herself? Well, that&rsquo;s strange. The girl must have been out
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to other &ldquo;strange&rdquo; things, which were not likely to
meet the approbation of his family, Walter was silent. Not a word about
that Saturnalia, or the omission of grace at a &ldquo;warm meal&rdquo;!
Nor did he mention the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171">171</a>]</span>liberties that were allowed the children, or
the freedom with which they joined in the conversation. Perhaps it was
a superfluous precaution. That bearskin would have been excused for
many shortcomings.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Pieterse asked repeatedly if he had been
&ldquo;respectable.&rdquo; Walter said he had, but without knowing
exactly what she meant. That affair with the spoon&mdash;had it been
respectable? He didn&rsquo;t care to have this question
decided&mdash;at least by his mother. But it was nice of Sietske; and
wouldn&rsquo;t he have done the same?</p>

<p>He learned that the day was approaching when he must return to
school. More than ever he felt that this source of knowledge was
insufficient for him; but opposition was not to be thought of. He was
dissatisfied with himself, with everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never amount to anything,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>

<p>His Lady Macbeth seemed uglier to him than ever. He tore her up. And
Ophelia?</p>

<p>Goodness! He hadn&rsquo;t thought of Femke the whole day. Was it
because she was only a wash-girl, while the doctor&rsquo;s children
were so aristocratic? Walter censured himself.</p>

<p>He took advantage of the first opportunity to pay his debt in that
quarter. For he felt that it was a debt; and this consciousness gave
him courage. Picture in hand, he passed the familiar fence this time
and knocked boldly on the door. His heart was thumping terribly; but he
must do it! In a moment he stood before Femke. The lady of his heart
was quietly darning stockings. It is hard on the writer; but this
little detail was a matter of indifference to Walter. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172">172</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, extending her hand. &ldquo;Mother, this
is the young gentleman we saw that time&mdash;the little boy who was so
sick. And how are you now? You look pale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a seat, little boy,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;Yes,
you do look pale. Worms, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, mother. The child has had nervous fever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;fever, then; but it could be from worms. Give
him a cup, Femke. It won&rsquo;t hurt you to drink coffee; but if it
were worms&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Claus&rsquo;s worms were more in Walter&rsquo;s way than the
stockings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where does your mother have her washing done?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;Not that I want to pump you&mdash;not at all. But if she
isn&rsquo;t satisfied with her wash-woman&mdash;it sometimes happens,
you understand. Everybody must look out for himself; and I just thought
I&rsquo;d mention it. Whenever there are any ink-spots Femke takes them
out with oxalic acid; and it never makes any holes&mdash;yes, it did
happen once, and we had to pay for a pair of cuffs. You can ask
Femke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact was, he wanted to ask Femke something else; and she knew
it. The story of Aztalpa had left its marks on her mind. But she was
hampered very much like Walter was at home. She couldn&rsquo;t say,
&ldquo;Mother, speak a bit more Peruvian!&rdquo; So she simply asked
what the roll was that he had in his hand.</p>

<p>Walter was confused, but he managed to stammer that it was a present
for her. Femke said she would always take good care of the picture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;and you must iron out
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>those
creases. We iron, too, little boy, and we deliver the clothes ready to
put on. Nobody can complain. You can tell your mother. And your
collar&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t ironed nicely&mdash;and such bluing! Ask
Femke. Femke, isn&rsquo;t the blue in stripes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His collar not ironed nicely? and blued in stripes? And the
infallible Pietro had laundered it! Even here, were there differences
in method and conception? And in this respect, too, was the Pieterse
tradition not the only one that brought happiness?</p>

<p>Femke was on nettles. She studied Ophelia, wondering who she was,
and tried to turn the conversation. At last something occurred to her.
It was necessary for her to run some errand or other, and &ldquo;the
young gentleman&rdquo; could &ldquo;accompany&rdquo; her a part of the
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; said the mother.</p>

<p>The young couple retired, taking one of those ways which in the
neighborhood of Amsterdam are simply called &ldquo;the ways.&rdquo;
That is all they are. Whoever walks there for pleasure must take a good
stock of impressions with him, in order to escape tedium.</p>

<p>But Walter and Femke were not lacking in this respect. Walter had so
much to tell Femke that he could scarcely hope to get through; and she,
too, had thought of him more than she was willing to admit, and more
than he had any idea of. She began by saying that she hadn&rsquo;t told
her mother of her unfriendly reception by Walter&rsquo;s mother and
sisters, because she didn&rsquo;t want her mother&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Femke&mdash;and you thought I would come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; said Femke, hesitating, but still with a <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>readiness
that delighted Walter. &ldquo;Yes, of course I expected to see you
again. And I had a mass said for your recovery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Walter, who hardly knew what it meant.
&ldquo;You did that for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I prayed, too. I should have been sad if you had
died. For I believe you are a good boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to have come sooner; and I wanted to,
but&mdash;Femke, I was afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He related to her how he had been near her on Sunday. The girl
attributed his timidity to his diffidence toward her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother is a good woman. She wouldn&rsquo;t hurt anybody,
but&mdash;you understand. She doesn&rsquo;t mix with people much. I
understand the world better, because, you see, I was a nurse for three
weeks. I was only substituting; I was too young to be a real nurse. It
was at a relation&rsquo;s of ours, where the girl was sick. You know we
really come of a good family. But that makes no difference. Tell me,
are you well and strong again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter told her now all about his sickness, and soon he came
involuntarily to the thing that gave him most trouble, his defective
knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the children know French; but at our school it
isn&rsquo;t taught. It&rsquo;s impossible to be a great man without
knowing French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter had difficulty in explaining to her that he meant something
other than the possession of three houses, though that might not be
bad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like&mdash;you understand? I should
like&mdash;yes&mdash;I should like&mdash;how shall I explain?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175">175</a>]</span></p>

<p>The sovereignty of Africa was on the end of his tongue; but he
didn&rsquo;t have the courage to put his dreams into words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Femke, that we live here in Europe. Now, down there
in the south, far away&mdash;I will draw it for you. We can sit down
here and I will show you exactly what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He selected some small sticks suitable for making outlines on the
ground, then he and Femke sat down on a low pile of boards. He
proceeded to scratch up the sand for some distance around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is Europe. The earth is round; that is, it consists of
two halves, like a doughnut. You see, it looks like a pair of
spectacles. With that half we are not concerned. That&rsquo;s America.
You can put your feet on it if you want to. Here is where we live;
there is England; and here is Africa. The people there are uncivilized.
They can&rsquo;t read, and they don&rsquo;t wear many clothes. But when
a traveler comes along they are very nice to him&mdash;the book says
so. I&rsquo;m going down there and teach all the people to read and
give them clothes and see to it that there is no injustice done in the
whole land. And then we will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too?&rdquo; asked Femke in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly! I wanted to ask you if you were willing to go
with me. We will be man and wife, you understand; so when I get to be
king you will be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? Queen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed. Involuntarily she rose and trampled to pieces all the
kingdoms that Walter had just laid at her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;won&rsquo;t you be my wife?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176">176</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you boy! How did you get such nonsense into your head?
You are still a child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you wait then till I&rsquo;m grown up? Will you let me
be your friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly! Only you mustn&rsquo;t think of that
nonsense&mdash;not that you may not go to Africa later. Why not? Many
people go on journeys. Formerly there lived a carpenter near us, and he
went to the Haarlem with his whole family.
But&mdash;marrying!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed again. It pained Walter. The poor boy&rsquo;s first
proposal was turning out badly.</p>

<p>Suddenly Femke became serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that you are a good boy; and I think a great deal of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I!&rdquo; cried Walter. &ldquo;Femke, I have thought of
you all the time&mdash;when I was sick&mdash;in my fever&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know what I thought of in my fever, but I think it must
have been you. And I talked to the picture I painted for you as if it
were you; and that picture answered like you and looked like you. I was
Kusco and Telasco, and you were Aztalpa, the daughter of the sun. Tell
me, Femke, may I be your friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl reflected a moment; and in her pure, innocent heart she
felt the desire to do good. Was that seventeen-year-old girl conscious
of the influence that Walter&rsquo;s childish soul exerted upon her?
Scarcely. But she wanted to give him a less cruel answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly you shall be my friend.
But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was hunting for some excuse that would not hurt him, and still
let him see the difference in their ages. He had grown during his
illness, to be sure, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href=
"#pb177">177</a>]</span>but still&mdash;she could have carried him on
her arm. And he had dreamed of rescuing her from a fire!</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend, yes. But then you must do everything that I
require.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything, everything! Tell me quick what I can do for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was painful for the girl. She didn&rsquo;t know what she should
require; but she was under the necessity of naming something. She had
always heard that it was good for children to study hard. What if she
should spur him on to do that?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Walter. Just for fun I told my mother that you were
the best in school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; cried Walter abashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Study hard and be the first in school inside the next three
months,&rdquo; said Femke to the conqueror of continents, unaware of
the sarcasm that lay in her words. &ldquo;Otherwise, you see, my mother
might think I had made fun of you; and I don&rsquo;t want that to
happen. If you will only do that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do it, Femke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must go home and begin at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus she sent him away. As she told him &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; she
noticed all at once that he was too large for her to kiss. A few hours
later, when Father Jansen was calling on her mother and incidentally
saw Walter&rsquo;s painting, Walter suddenly became a child again. The
priest had said that in Dutch Ophelia meant Flora, who was the
patron-saint of roses and forget-me-nots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that picture is from a little boy, a very small boy.
He&rsquo;s about ten years old&mdash;or nine. He&rsquo;s certainly not
older than nine!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href=
"#pb178">178</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Girl, you are foolish!&rdquo; cried the mother. &ldquo;The
boy is fifteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that may be&mdash;but I just meant that he&rsquo;s still
only a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stuck Ophelia away in some hidden nook, and Mrs. Claus and
Father Jansen never saw that new edition of the old flower-goddess
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Femke, I will do it!&rdquo; Walter had said.</p>

<p>There was really reason to believe that he would learn faster now;
but Pennewip&rsquo;s instruction would wear Femke&rsquo;s colors.
Walter knew very well that in requiring this service she had had his
own welfare in view; but this showed her interest in him, and was not
so bad. How would it have looked, he thought, if, after all that had
gone before, he had answered: &ldquo;Everything except that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course he would have greatly preferred to serve his lady on some
journey full of adventure. But one cannot select for one&rsquo;s self
heroic deeds. In these days Hercules and St. George would have to put
up with <span class="corr" id="xd0e3980" title="Source: minature">
miniature</span> dragons.</p>

<p>At all events, Walter took hold of his work in earnest. He studied
his &ldquo;Ippel,&rdquo; his &ldquo;Strabbe,&rdquo; his &ldquo;National
History&rdquo; and even the &ldquo;Gender of Nouns,&rdquo; and
everything else necessary to the education of a good Netherlander.
Poetry was included; and Walter&rsquo;s accomplishments along this line
were such that other &ldquo;Herculeses&rdquo; might have envied
him.</p>

<p>He had never read the stories of tournaments. No enchantress gave
him a charmed coat of mail; no Minerva put the head of Medusa on his
shield&mdash;no, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href=
"#pb179">179</a>]</span>nothing of all that. But&mdash;Keesje, the
butcher&rsquo;s boy, might look sharp for his laurels!</p>

<p>In justice to Walter it must be said that he gave his opponent fair
warning, in true knightly style.</p>

<p>At the end of three months Walter was actually the first in his
classes. Pennewip was compelled to take notice of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I might say that it
is remarkable. Yes, in a way, it is unprecedented&mdash;without a
parallel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At home the result was that a great council was held regarding
Walter&rsquo;s future. He didn&rsquo;t want to become a compositor; and
to be a sailor&mdash;that would have suited him, but his mother was
opposed to it. Stoffel, too, objected on the ground that usually only
young people who are worthless on land are sent to sea.</p>

<p>Thus Walter&rsquo;s plans for conquest were slipping away from him.
He was not attracted by the brilliant careers that were proposed: They
left Africa out of account. He didn&rsquo;t want to be a
school-teacher, or a shoemaker, or a clerk, or a counter-jumper.</p>

<p>However, after all authorities had been heard, Stoffel came to the
conclusion that Walter was peculiarly well fitted for
&ldquo;business.&rdquo; Juffrouw Pieterse agreed with him thoroughly.

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXII</h2>

<p>&ldquo;A responsible business firm wants a young man (Dt. Ref.) of
good family. He must be moral, well-behaved and not under fifteen years
old. Prospect of salary if diligent and reliable. Good treatment
guaranteed. Address written applications in own handwriting to
&lsquo;Business,&rsquo; care E. Maaskamp&rsquo;s book and art store,
Nieuwendyk, Amsterdam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The writer cannot recall what sort of art publications E. Maaskamp
was dealing in just at that time, and will not make any guesses, for
fear of getting the reader into chronological difficulties. If it
should become necessary in writing Walter&rsquo;s history, the writer
would have no compunctions of conscience in putting the republic after
Louis, or William I. before the republic.</p>

<p>And as for that &ldquo;Dt. Ref.&rdquo;&mdash;Dutch Reform&mdash;in
the advertisement&mdash;that gives the writer no trouble. He knows very
well that &ldquo;Dt. Ref.&rdquo; as a necessary qualification for
servants, apprentices, etc., was introduced after E. Maaskamp&rsquo;s
pictures had been forgotten. Nevertheless, it must be insisted upon
that the aforesaid abbreviation was in the advertisement which was now
occupying the undivided attention of the Pieterses. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181">181</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There couldn&rsquo;t be anything more fortunate,&rdquo; said
the mother. &ldquo;What do you think, Stoffel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother, it couldn&rsquo;t be better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What pleases me especially is the
&lsquo;well-behaved.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moral and well-behaved, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, moral and well-behaved&mdash;do you hear, Walter? Just
as I have always said. And &lsquo;prospect of salary.&rsquo; What do
you think of that, Stoffel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother; but&mdash;he must be &lsquo;diligent and
reliable.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Walter, you must be diligent and reliable. Haven&rsquo;t
I always told you that? And they require &lsquo;Dt. Ref.&rsquo;; but
you are that, thank God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother, he&rsquo;s that all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stoffel, don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d better write the
letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it says &lsquo;in own handwriting.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so! But if you write the letter in your own
handwriting&mdash;that will be better than for such a child to write
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel had some difficulty in making it plain to his mother that
&ldquo;own handwriting&rdquo; meant Walter&rsquo;s own handwriting; but
she finally saw the point, and Walter was given a seat at the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well? What must I write at the top?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, have you forgotten that again? Such a simple thing? Have
you got down the date? Then write &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; in business
style. It says, &lsquo;responsible business firm.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;and add that your father
had a business, too. We sold shoes from Paris. Otherwise they will
think we&rsquo;re only shoemakers.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>&ldquo;And write that you are the first in school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that you belong to the Dutch Reform Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that you are moral and well-behaved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that you are diligent and reliable. Don&rsquo;t you see,
you may get a salary then right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the letter was ready. It only remained to stamp it and post
it. But why couldn&rsquo;t the young applicant deliver the letter in
person and save the postage? Stoffel thought there would be no
impropriety in such a course. Even a responsible business firm ought to
overlook such a detail.</p>

<p>With a heavy heart Walter started out on his important errand. He
was entering the real world, and was about to become a worshiper of the
great god of &ldquo;business.&rdquo; He was depressed by his lack of
confidence, and felt that it was unbecoming in himself to make
application to a &ldquo;responsible business firm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he met a man that looked well-to-do, he would ask himself if the
gentleman was a &ldquo;business man,&rdquo; and belonged to a
&ldquo;responsible business firm.&rdquo; This last high-sounding
expression embodied mysteries which he did not attempt to understand.
He would learn it all later.</p>

<p>Walter stammered an excuse to the young fellow in the shop for not
having sent his letter by post. The fellow didn&rsquo;t understand him,
but threw the letter carelessly into a box containing a few dozen
others that were awaiting the favorable consideration of Messrs. Motto,
Business &amp; Co.</p>

<p>The fellow was busy with some Turkish battles in glaring colors, and
declined to enter into any conversation <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb183" href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>with our hero. Walter&rsquo;s
mouth watered for a bright picture of Grecian chivalry. But what good
did it do? He had no money; and, besides, he was out for business, not
for heroic deeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later!&rdquo; he thought.</p>

<p>Arrived at home he received the usual scolding. His mother
maintained that he had certainly not entered the shop in a
&ldquo;respectable&rdquo; manner; otherwise the young gentleman would
have given him a friendlier reception. She was afraid that those
excellent gentlemen, Motto, Business &amp; Co., would take this into
consideration to his detriment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you say there were already a whole lot of letters there?
You see, Stoffel&mdash;if he only isn&rsquo;t too late! That&rsquo;s
the way&mdash;those people would break their necks or be first. And who
knows but what some of them are Roman Catholics? I wonder if they all
think they&rsquo;re moral and well-behaved. You can just see what kind
of people there are in the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter had to go back to Maaskamp&rsquo;s and get the address of the
firm in question. The idea was for him to call on the firm in person
and thus get ahead of everybody else. Juffrouw Pieterse wanted to bet
her ears that not a one of the other applicants could boast of a father
who had sold Parisian shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell them that! Your father never took a stitch in his life.
He didn&rsquo;t even know how to. It&rsquo;s only to prove that we had
a business, too. He never had an awl in his hand&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it
so, Stoffel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those eminently respectable gentlemen, Motto, Business &amp; Co.,
lived&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where they lived; but they had founded
on the Zeedyk a cigar store and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184"
href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>a circulating library. It was probably not
far from the place where six or eight centuries earlier a few fishermen
had founded the greatest commercial city of Europe.</p>

<p>Walter found one of those worthy gentlemen behind the counter. He
was in his shirt-sleeves, and was engaged in weighing out some snuff
for an old woman. &ldquo;Business&rdquo; was evidently being carried
on.</p>

<p>As Walter had formed no conception of &ldquo;responsible business
firm,&rdquo; he was far from thinking that the gentlemen had claimed
too much for themselves. With his peculiar timidity he even reproached
himself for not having understood the conception &ldquo;business&rdquo;
before.</p>

<p>Now he understood it. Business meant to stand behind a counter, in
shirt-sleeves, and weigh snuff. And, too, on the Zeedyk.</p>

<p>The cigar store occupied only half the width of the house, and was
connected with the circulating library by a side door. Motto, Business
&amp; Co. were simultaneously cultivating two industries: those who
didn&rsquo;t care for snuff or tobacco could get something to read, and
vice versa.</p>

<p>Over the shelves, on the tobacco side, were posted signs bearing the
assurance that something was &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; here. Differing
entirely from the Pieterses, these gentlemen seemed to think that to
make a thing meant more than merely to sell it. We leave the question
undecided.</p>

<p>Was it true that this business firm manufactured anything? The only
thing they manufactured was the paper bags that were to be pasted
together by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185">185</a>]</span>moral, well-behaved, diligent and reliable
young man who was a member of the Dutch Reform Church.</p>

<p>The amount of business done was small, the profits barely paying the
rent. The wicked world on the Zeedyk even said that the two blue
porcelain vases bearing in old-fashioned letters the inscriptions
&ldquo;Rappee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zinking,&rdquo; had been borrowed from
a second-hand dealer in the neighborhood, and that the good man came by
every day to look after his property.</p>

<p>The shop was small, and was closed off in the rear by a green
curtain, which was calculated to make customers think there was
something more beyond. To be exact, there <i>was</i> something beyond
that curtain. There hung a dilapidated mirror, consoling with a lonely
chair, which was now ornamented by the coat of the worthy senior
partner; and leaning against the wall was a half-round table, on which
a pomatum-pot was making fun of a comb because for years it had been
expecting to grow new teeth. Business was not so exacting but that Mr.
Motto could devote a little spare time to the improvement of his
personal beauty. He had succeeded in developing two beautiful bunches
of hair on the sides of his face. They cost him much pains and grease;
but they were the delight of all the ladies who entered the shop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you want to go into business, do you?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Motto, after he had given the old woman a &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; from the
jar. &ldquo;What all have you studied? Reading, writing, arithmetic,
French? Eh? And what are your parents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They dealt in shoes&mdash;from Paris, M&rsquo;neer. But I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href=
"#pb186">186</a>]</span>don&rsquo;t know French. Arithmetic&mdash;yes.
Went through Strabbe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you know arithmetic, do you? How much then is a Pietje
and a half?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter stammered that he didn&rsquo;t know. Does the reader
know?</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must know that if you expect to calculate. And you
don&rsquo;t know what a Pietje is? Do you know the difference between a
sesthalf and a shilling? And between a dollar and a twenty-eight piece?
Look&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Motto pulled out the cash-drawer and seemed to be hunting for a
dollar; but for some reason or other he decided to make out with a
sesthalf. This he laid on the counter and asked Walter to imagine a
shilling lying beside it. He then proceeded to test Walter&rsquo;s
knowledge of business by asking him to point out the differences
between the two coins. Mr. Motto claimed that in business one must know
these details thoroughly.</p>

<p>And Mr. Motto was right about it. At that time there were more
different kinds of money in the Netherlands than there are in Germany
now. To be able to distinguish the various coins readily and make
change accurately a regular course of study was necessary. Just as a
law was about to be passed to confer the title, &ldquo;Doctor of
Numismatics,&rdquo; on examination, the secretary of the treasury
discovered that all this trouble could be spared by simplifying the
money. He became very unpopular after this.</p>

<p>In Walter&rsquo;s time, though, such a reform had not been thought
of. The florin had twenty stivers; the regular Holland dollar had fifty
stivers, the Zeeland <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187">187</a>]</span>dollar had forty-two. The dollar was worth a
florin and a half, and the gold florin was called a
&ldquo;twenty-eight,&rdquo; because it contained twenty-eight stivers.
The coins were well-worn and seldom exhibited any traces of
inscriptions, milling, etc. Matters were further complicated by
three-florin pieces and ducats of sixty-three stivers, not to mention
any other coins.</p>

<p>For Walter the money question was a serious one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t know French, either?&rdquo; in a tone
that was scarcely encouraging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; mournfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And would your parents put up cash security for
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter didn&rsquo;t understand the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caution. Don&rsquo;t you understand? Security! There&rsquo;s
lots of money handled, and I must know who I&rsquo;m turning the shop
over to. And&mdash;do you know Danish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Motto did not always speak grammatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;M&rsquo;neer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Nor Danish, either? But Danish sailors come in here to
buy tobacco, and then you need to speak Danish. In a business like this
here you must know all languages. That&rsquo;s the main
thing&mdash;otherwise your cake&rsquo;s dough! I&rsquo;ve even had
Greeks to come in here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter&rsquo;s heart gave a jump. What heroic deeds might they not
do on such occasions!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Greeks; but they were drunk and wanted a smoke for
nothing. We don&rsquo;t do it that way. The main thing is to look out
for the little things. Otherwise your cake&rsquo;s dough, you
understand. Yes, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href=
"#pb188">188</a>]</span>business you must know all languages, otherwise
you can&rsquo;t talk to the customers. That&rsquo;s the main thing. But
that will be all right if your parents can deposit a caution. Sometimes
there are at least ten florins in the cash-drawer, you know; and in
business a man must have security. That&rsquo;s the main thing.
Otherwise your cake&rsquo;s dough; you can see that for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father is dead,&rdquo; said Walter, as if that fact
rendered the cash security unnecessary. He didn&rsquo;t know anything
else to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That so? Dead! Yes, it often happens. Dead? All right! But
haven&rsquo;t you a mother who can pay for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;will&mdash;ask&mdash;her,&rdquo; Walter
stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Ask her right away; for you know in business
things are done in a hurry. Said, done! That&rsquo;s the main thing.
Otherwise your cake&rsquo;s dough. Here is another shop, and you will
have work to do in there, too&mdash;if your mother can put up the
money. That&rsquo;s the main thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Motto conducted Walter into the circulating library. On three
sides of the room were bookcases reaching to the rather low ceiling.
For the rest, the place was provided with a ladder to be used in
gathering such fruits of literature as hung out of reach. And then
there was a big, thick book, in which the diligent and reliable young
man of Protestant faith was to enroll the names of the people who paid
a dubbeltje a week for a book. It&rsquo;s cheaper now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Mr. Motto, &ldquo;that is the book, so
to say the great book. You understand bookkeeping, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href=
"#pb189">189</a>]</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately Walter had to admit that he had not yet studied that
branch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor bookkeeping, either? Boy! that&rsquo;s the main thing in
business. If a man can&rsquo;t do that his cake&rsquo;s dough.
It&rsquo;s very simple. You write down who takes out a book, with the
day and date and street and number. And when they bring the book back
you drawn a line through it; and you&rsquo;ve got a pretty kettle of
fish if you don&rsquo;t do it. When you don&rsquo;t know the people you
must&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask for a deposit!&rdquo; cried Walter quickly, rejoiced that
he knew something. It&rsquo;s doubtful if he knew what he was to draw
the line through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a deposit. A florin a week for a volume. Then, you
understand, when a volume&rsquo;s gone, the cake&rsquo;s dough with
that volume. Later I will explain to you everything about the cigars
and tobacco; but first I must know whether your mother&mdash;ask her
right away! And now I&rsquo;ve explained everything to you at least
half a dozen times. For there&rsquo;s no lack of boys that want to go
into business; but when it comes to Moses and the Prophets&mdash;then
they set the bow-sails. And that&rsquo;s the main thing. Otherwise you
look a little delicate, but I must know first if your mother can
deposit a caution. <i>Adieu!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter went home in a peculiar frame of mind. At first the family
did not think favorably of that &ldquo;cash security.&rdquo; Stoffel,
however, had often heard of such things, and negotiations were opened
with the said firm. It was finally agreed that a deposit of one hundred
florins should be made, for which the firm agreed to pay 3&frac12;%
interest. <span class="corr" id="xd0e4168" title="Source: Juffrow">
Juffrouw</span> Pieterse was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href=
"#pb190">190</a>]</span>not quite satisfied with this, as she was
accustomed to getting 4%; but &ldquo;one must do something for
one&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel, who represented the Pieterses in these negotiations, was
surprised that he never got to see more than the first half of the
firm&mdash;or, better, the first third. He even took the liberty of
remarking on the peculiar circumstance, when he learned that the
&ldquo;Co.&rdquo; was merely ornamental, while &ldquo;Business&rdquo;
existed only in Mr. Motto&rsquo;s imagination. In fact that handsome
and worthy gentleman alone constituted the &ldquo;responsible business
firm,&rdquo; and like an Atlas carried on his broad shoulders all the
responsibilities incident to such a complicated and extensive
undertaking. It was quite natural that he should desire to put a part
of the burden on the back of some diligent, reliable Protestant boy,
who could furnish cash security. For that was &ldquo;the main
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the library side Walter developed a diligence against which only
one thing could be urged: it was prejudicial to the tobacco industry
adjoining. If he had smoked as much as he read, he would have made
himself sick; and even his reading wasn&rsquo;t the best thing in the
world for his health.</p>

<p>He devoured everything indiscriminately&mdash;whether ripe or green.
Most of that literary fruit was green. In a short time he was able to
foretell the fate of the hero with a certainty that would have piqued
the author. The cleverest literary craftsman couldn&rsquo;t let the
poor orphan boy be as poor as a church mouse for ten pages, but that
Walter would see the flashing of the stars and knightly crucifixes with
which he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191">191</a>]</span>to be decked out on the last page. One might
think this would cause him to lose interest in the book; but, no! He
was constant to the end&mdash;to the official triumph. For him it would
have been a sin to call to the Saxons and Normans a second too soon:
&ldquo;See if Ivanhoe isn&rsquo;t going to smash that big-mouthed Sir
Brian de Bois-Guilbert!&rdquo; And all the time he felt as if he
were&mdash;Ivanhoe? No, as if he were the deity, who must give the hero
strength to overcome that infamous scoundrel, Brian de
Bois-Guilbert.</p>

<p>Then all at once the door-bell would ring, and the magnanimous
Walter would have to occupy himself with things less chivalrous.</p>

<p>The only thing he could do in such moments was to weigh accurately,
and not give anybody a cigar from the &ldquo;tens&rdquo; instead of
from the &ldquo;eights.&rdquo; Such conscienciousness, however, was
futile, for in the cigar-boxes were cigars that ought to have been
called &ldquo;twenties.&rdquo; Mr. Motto said that the customers were
usually drunk, and that it was all right to give them cabbage leaves to
smoke. &ldquo;You must size up your customer. That&rsquo;s the main
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was something Walter never could learn. With him, ten was ten,
eight eight&mdash;no matter who the customer was. To take an unfair
advantage, or tell a lie never occurred to him. From fear or
embarrassment he might possibly tell an untruth; but if he had been
asked a second time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>As strange as it may seem, this aversion to lying and deception was
nourished by the books he read. The brave knight fought till he was
victorious, or dead. Only the fatally wounded surrendered. All <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>this had
Walter&rsquo;s hearty endorsement: He would not have acted differently.
The beautiful heroine was loved by everybody; and the rejected suitors
died of despair, or joined some desperate band. All quite proper. The
good remained steadfast, in spite of the Devil and all his
machinations&mdash;yes, in spite of tedium. Once selected by the author
to be a high-toned, moral hero&mdash;then spotless garments! Walter
wondered if such a one could have a pain in the stomach, or suffer
other inconvenience. Certainly not in books!</p>

<p>He did not know that such perfection was humbug. He was satisfied
when the characters in such novels did what was required of them by the
author. The villains were always betraying somebody; the heroes killed
everything that got in their way; and the beautiful virgins charmed
everybody. Even God, the God of romance, did his duty much better
than&mdash;but that&rsquo;s another detail.</p>

<p>Yesterday on the Zeedyk a big boy had beaten a little fellow. That
ought to happen in a book. How all the knights would have come running!
Walter, too, was going to&mdash;but how could he help it if his
employer called him back? &ldquo;What in the devil have you got to do
with that? Your work is here in the store. You attend to your own
business now, and don&rsquo;t mix yourself in other people&rsquo;s
brawls. That&rsquo;s the main thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a rule of conduct, this was not just what Walter was used to in
his novels.</p>

<p>Despite such interruptions he continued his reading. He was almost
ready to begin on the last section of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb193" href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>books, when he came to the store
one morning and found everything locked up and under seal.</p>

<p>The worthy Mr. Motto, it seems, had gone to America, as a sailor;
and doubtless that was the &ldquo;main thing.&rdquo; The unfortunate
owner of the two snuff-vases had a big law suit over them. The point
was whether they were a part of the assets, or not.</p>

<p>On the Zeedyk at Amsterdam such processes must be tried according to
Roman law; but as the Romans did not use snuff there is nothing said
about &ldquo;Rappee&rdquo; in the Roman laws. The writer doesn&rsquo;t
know how the matter finally turned out. It is to be hoped that
everybody got what was coming to him.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Pieterse, however, did not recover her hundred florins;
and, as usual, she groaned: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always trouble with
this boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter couldn&rsquo;t help her. He had his own troubles: he had been
cruelly interrupted in his reading. Of course the mysterious parentage
of the young robber was perfectly clear to him; but still one likes to
see whether one has guessed correctly, or not. <span class="pagenum">

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXIII</h2>

<p><span class="corr" id="xd0e4214" title="Not in source">
&ldquo;</span>Do you think stivers grow on my back?&rdquo; asked the
mother the next day. &ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t earn a doit! Do you
have to buy tobacco for old soldiers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter had nothing to say. Recently his mother had given him a
shilling to give to Holsma&rsquo;s maid. Walter neglected to do this,
and spent one stiver of the money on snuff for an old soldier.</p>

<p>The mother continued her tirade, making use of the word
&ldquo;prodigue,&rdquo; prodigal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; said Stoffel, &ldquo;that isn&rsquo;t it.
He&rsquo;s behind in everything. He doesn&rsquo;t know yet how to
handle money, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He doesn&rsquo;t know how to handle money! All the other
children at his age&mdash;when they have a stiver they either save it
or buy themselves something. And he&mdash;what does he do? He goes and
gives it away! Boy, boy, will you never learn any sense?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was cut to the quick by the accusation of wastefulness and
prodigality. In his eyes a prodigal was somebody, a man!
&ldquo;Prodigue, prodigue,&rdquo; he murmured. He knew the word.</p>

<p>In one of the bedrooms hung a series of crude, highly colored
pictures illustrating the story of the prodigal son. The pictures were
French; and a study <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=
"#pb195">195</a>]</span>of the titles convinced the family that
&ldquo;prodigue&rdquo; could mean nothing but prodigal in the worst
sense, <i>i. e.</i>, &ldquo;lost.&rdquo; Stoffel had maintained this
proposition against one of his colleagues, till that one drew a lexicon
on him.</p>

<p>After much argument it was decided to compromise on the
&ldquo;mistake&rdquo; in the French Bible by allowing
&ldquo;prodigue&rdquo; to have sometimes the meaning of
&ldquo;extravagant.&rdquo; Those pictures had afforded Walter much food
for thought.</p>

<p><i>First picture:</i> The &ldquo;lost&rdquo; or prodigal son tells
his father good-bye. The old gentleman wears a purple coat. Very
pretty&mdash;but the prodigal himself! A mantle floated about his
shoulders&mdash;it seemed to be windy in the colonnade. It was
princely; and his turkish trousers were of pure gold. At his side was a
bent sabre, and on his head a turban, with a stone in
it&mdash;certainly onyx, or sardonox, or a pearl, or a precious
stone&mdash;or whatever it might be!</p>

<p>The old gentleman seemed to be out of humor; but no wonder&mdash;all
those loaded camels, and the slaves, and all the accessories for that
long, long journey! A negro, as black as pitch, was holding a horse by
the rein. Another negro was holding the stirrup, and seemed to say:
&ldquo;Off to the Devil; prodigal, get on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What boy wouldn&rsquo;t have been a prodigal son? The bent sabre
alone was worth the sin.</p>

<p><i>Second picture:</i> Hm&mdash;hm. Wicked, wicked! Why, certainly;
but not for Walter, who in his innocence attached no importance to the
extravagant dresses of the &ldquo;Juffrouwen.&rdquo; It was sufficient
that all were eating and drinking bountifully, and that they <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>were in
good <span class="corr" id="xd0e4250" title="Source: spirts">
spirits</span> and enjoying themselves. How prettily one of the girls,
in glossy silk, was leaning over the shoulder of the &ldquo;lost&rdquo;
one! How much nicer to be lost than found!&mdash;anyway, that was the
impression the feast made on Walter. The true purpose of the
picture&mdash;to deter people from a life of
dissoluteness&mdash;escaped Walter entirely. Perhaps he knew what it
meant; but in his heart he felt that it meant something else. What
attracted him most was not the food and drink, under which the table
&ldquo;groaned,&rdquo; nor the sinful sensuality painted on the faces
of the ladies. It was the freedom and unconventionality of the company
that charmed him. In order to emphasize the idea of prodigality, the
painter had allowed some big dogs to upset an open cask of wine.</p>

<p>The wine was streaming, and straying away as if it were the lost
sinner. This pleased Walter immensely. None of the guests seemed to
notice such a small trifle, not even the waiters. This ought to have
happened just once in the Pieterse home&mdash;and even if it were only
a stein of beer!</p>

<p>The artist says to himself, Do you suppose I didn&rsquo;t foresee
the seductive influence of such a picture? The next one makes it all
right!</p>

<p>Well, maybe so.</p>

<p><i>Third picture:</i> Magnificent. How romantic this wilderness! Oh,
to sit there on that boulder and stare into the immeasurable depths of
the universe&mdash;alone!</p>

<p>To think, think, think!</p>

<p>No schoolmaster, no mother, brother, or anyone to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>say what he must
do with his heart, with his time, with his elbows, or with his
breeches! That&rsquo;s the way Walter saw it. The young man there
didn&rsquo;t even have on breeches; and he looked as if he
wouldn&rsquo;t have been ashamed to stretch himself out on his back,
with his arms over his head, and watch with wide-open eyes the passing
of the moon and stars. Walter asked himself what he would think of when
he had founded such an empire of solitude.</p>

<p>Hm! Femke could sit on the boulder with him. Prodigal son&mdash;oh,
sin divine with her! He was surprised that in the whole Bible there was
only one prodigal son. Of all sins this seemed to him the most
seductive.</p>

<p>And the desert was so&mdash;endurable. There were trees in it, which
one could climb, when one really got lost, or use to build a nice
little cabin&mdash;for Femke, of course.</p>

<p>The prodigal in the picture didn&rsquo;t seem to have thought of all
that. Why wasn&rsquo;t the Juffrouw in green silk with him? She will
come soon, Walter said to himself. Perhaps she&rsquo;s not quite
through with her prodigality. If she would only hurry up and come! He
longs for her. But that is the only annoyance that a genuine prodigal
takes with him from the profane world into that capital wilderness.</p>

<p>It must be remarked in passing, however, that the hogs with which
that picture was equipped looked ugly. The pious artist had made them
shield-bearers of sin, and had supplied their physiognomies with all
kinds of horrible features. And, too, the trough looked dirty. <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198">198</a>]</span></p>

<p>If it happens to me, said Walter, I&rsquo;ll take sheep with me; and
Femke can card the wool.</p>

<p>The artist ought to admit that even this third picture is inadequate
to inspire a proper disgust for prodigality.</p>

<p>And the fourth one? No better.</p>

<p>The old gentleman is excessively friendly. We are again in the
colonnade, where the camels have just waited so patiently. One of the
slaves clasps his hands and looks toward heaven&mdash;because
he&rsquo;s glad, of course, that little Walter has come back.</p>

<p>He? The real Walter? Returned home, and friendly received in his
high rank of a &ldquo;has-been&rdquo; and &ldquo;recovered&rdquo;
prodigal? Oh, no!</p>

<p>And that fatted calf! In direct opposition to the custom that was
familiar to Walter! It worried the boy. Juffrouw Pieterse never
slaughtered anything. She ran a weekly account with Keesje&rsquo;s
father; and even a roast was a rarity.</p>

<p>There was no prospect of a fatted calf, whether he became a prodigal
or not. But that didn&rsquo;t keep the rank of a prodigal from being
higher than that of a stupid boy who didn&rsquo;t know how to handle
money.</p>

<p>He was encouraged to think that he was indebted to his friendly
enemy, Juffrouw Laps, for something. She always cited the Bible, and
spoke continually of feeding swine. Walter wanted to answer:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very nice, Juffrouw Laps, but can&rsquo;t it be
sheep this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew very well that she had never had any passion for carding,
and consequently was not interested <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb199" href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>in that blue muffler, which would
be so becoming to Femke&rsquo;s favorite sheep.</p>

<p>But she assured him that he was a prodigal; and that was enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always said!&rdquo; replied
Juffrouw Pieterse. &ldquo;What does he do but squander his
mother&rsquo;s money? If that man wants snuff, let him buy it. The king
pays him. I have to work too hard for my money. Don&rsquo;t I,
Stoffel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother; but it&rsquo;s only childishness in
Walter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Childishness! That&rsquo;s what I call it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the pious Laps.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on the straight road to the trough of Luke 15. He
will eat husks! Do you think the Master doesn&rsquo;t carry out his
parables? Just send him to me. The pastors are to blame for it. They
don&rsquo;t explain the Bible. Send him to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I only knew how he gets such things into his
head!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know? It&rsquo;s arrogance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrogance, Arrogance pure and simple&mdash;just as it was in
Belshazzar, or Sennacherib, or Nebuchadnezzar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How thankful Walter was! If at this moment he had had a letter to
write&mdash;preferably to Femke&mdash;he would have boasted of being as
wicked as three old kings put together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrogance!&rdquo; repeated Juffrouw Laps. &ldquo;Gold on top,
iron in the middle, and feet of clay. The Master will overthrow him.
Send him to me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=
"#pb200">200</a>]</span></p>

<p>This invitation to turn over the royal villain to her for religious
instruction was repeated so often that it was necessary to give her an
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dear Juffrouw, the boy don&rsquo;t want to. He&rsquo;s
stubborn; and what can one do with such a child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter knew that his mother was not quite truthful; but, after his
former experience with his friendly enemy, he found it desirable to
keep quiet. When pressed, however, for an explanation he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man wanted snuff, and nobody would give him any; so
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps knew enough. Walter was as good as her prisoner: she
now knew exactly how to take his fortifications, if they could be taken
at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t want to come to me, don&rsquo;t compel
him,&rdquo; she said sweetly on leaving. &ldquo;To force him
won&rsquo;t do any good. Let him exercise his own pleasure. I&rsquo;m
afraid you pick at the child too much, anyway. What an awful fuss
we&rsquo;ve made over a stiver!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say, too,&rdquo; replied the mother.
&ldquo;It looks as if we begrudged him the money! We could have spared
another stiver, and we wouldn&rsquo;t have missed it, would we,
Stoffel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother, but it&rsquo;s time for
Walter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness, what a hullaballoo to raise about a few pinches of
snuff! The Master will repay it seven times seventy times. Whatever ye
have done to the least of my brothers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this consoling passage on her lips she took her leave of the
astonished family.</p>

<p>Yes, it wasn&rsquo;t so easy to see through Juffrouw Laps! <span

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXIV</h2>

<p>In his efforts to reconcile the various conflicting authorities
contesting for supremacy in his soul, Walter threw himself into a
severe spell of blues. He was not conscious of the contrast between the
world of his high-flown fancy and the earthy environment of his
home-life. The sympathetic care which he should have received after his
illness had not fallen to his lot.</p>

<p>He felt dejected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Femke!&rdquo; he thought; and he longed for her fresh healthy
face, for her pure, unselfish glance, for her friendly smile. The Fancy
that had led him away to the stars in search of his misty sister had
got lodged on that girl of the Amsterdam lowlands, Femke&mdash;with her
unpoetical length, breadth, thickness, and weight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to see her,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I will! And if
Mrs. Claus asks me about worms a dozen times, it&rsquo;s all the same
to me; I am going to see her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter reached the house and knocked. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; someone
called. This was a little sudden, for it took some time to get hold of
the latch. But Walter did it. Perhaps he was thinking of
Missolonghi.</p>

<p>The Turks that he saw now were not revolting in appearance. They
were unarmed and did not murder a single baby. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202">202</a>]</span></p>

<p>But&mdash;Femke was not in the party.</p>

<p>Mrs. Claus was at the wash-tub, while Father Jansen was quietly
smoking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, young man? Very nice! That&rsquo;s the young man
who gave Femke the picture, you remember, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The father nodded to him kindly and smoked away, without manifesting
any special Godliness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Juffrouw, I wanted to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very nice of you! Won&rsquo;t you have a slice of bread and
butter? And how is your mother? Is she better now? She was sick,
wasn&rsquo;t she? That&rsquo;s a good boy, father. Femke said so. Is
your mother better again? It was fever, wasn&rsquo;t it? or
apoplexy&mdash;or what was it then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Juffrouw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t call me Juffrouw. I am only a wash-woman.
Everyone must stay in his own class, mustn&rsquo;t he, father? Well,
it&rsquo;s all the better; I thought she had been sick. It must have
been somebody else. One has so much to think of. Do you like
cheese?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good woman prepared a slice of bread and butter, with cheese. If
Trudie could have seen it, she would have fainted. In the
&ldquo;citizen&rsquo;s class,&rdquo; such and such a sub-class,
according to Pennewip, is found a certain scantiness that does not
obtain in the common laboring class. In the matter of eating, laborers,
who do not invest their money in Geneva, are not troubled so much by
&ldquo;good form&rdquo; as people who give their children French
names.</p>

<p>Walter had never seen such a slice of bread. He didn&rsquo;t know
whether he ought to bite through the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb203" href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>width, or the thickness. The bit
of cheese gave him his cue.</p>

<p>He liked Mrs. Claus much better this time. And Father Jansen, too;
even if he wasn&rsquo;t like Walter had imagined him to be.</p>

<p>He had never conceived a preacher as being anything else but a very
supernatural and spiritual and celestial sort of person. Father Jansen
didn&rsquo;t seem to be that kind of a man at all.</p>

<p>He visited the sheep of his fold, especially the plain people, not
to make a display of beneficence&mdash;for he had nothing, but because
he was happiest among simple people. He was fond of bread and butter of
the Mrs. Claus variety. For the rest, he said mass, preached about sin,
catechised, confirmed, absolved, and did whatever needed to be done. He
performed the functions of his office, and did not think it at all
strange that he should have gone into the church, while his brother in
Nordbrabant succeeded to the business of his father, who was a farrier
and inn-keeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are you going to be?&rdquo; he asked Walter;
&ldquo;for everybody in the world must be something. Wouldn&rsquo;t you
like to be a bookbinder? That&rsquo;s a good trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was&mdash;I was in business, M&rsquo;neer; and I&rsquo;m
going back to business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, my boy. You may get rich. Especially here
in Amsterdam; for Amsterdam is a commercial city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter wanted to add: &ldquo;The greatest commercial city of
Europe.&rdquo; But he was abashed by the&mdash;worldliness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>of Father
Jansen&rsquo;s talk. He didn&rsquo;t find it disagreeable: he was
merely surprised at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A boy like you ought to eat a lot. You look pale. My brother
can bend a horseshoe. What do you say to that? Have you ever eaten our
Brabant bread? Ham isn&rsquo;t bad, either. A person that doesn&rsquo;t
eat enough gets weak. I always eat two slices of bread and butter
whenever I&rsquo;m here at Mrs. Claus&rsquo;s; but I&rsquo;m not nearly
so strong as my brother. You ought to see the Vucht fair. That&rsquo;s
a great time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was more than surprised to hear such talk from a preacher: he
was almost pleased. He had never received such charming messages from
heaven. Of course they came from heaven, those friendly words uttered
in Brabant dialect between the puffs of Father Jansen&rsquo;s pipe.
This man in a priest&rsquo;s coat chattered away as if there were no
such thing in the world as God, Grace, and Hell&mdash;especially the
latter. He was as happy as a child in telling about the strength of his
brother, the horseshoer. It was his business to lead the world to
eternal happiness; and he liked thick slices of bread and butter with
cheese.</p>

<p>Walter had never had religious things opened up to him so
delightfully. He felt encouraged to speak:</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;neer, I would like to know who God is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father Jansen started, and looked at Walter as if he hadn&rsquo;t
clearly understood the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s very praiseworthy in you. You
must&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Claus, &ldquo;the child
isn&rsquo;t in the church! Are you?&rdquo;&mdash;to Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Juffrouw, I have been confirmed.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205">205</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, to be sure, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the Noordermarkt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see he&rsquo;s in the church all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good woman didn&rsquo;t have the heart&mdash;or else she had too
much heart&mdash;to tell the father that it wasn&rsquo;t the right
church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever wants to get acquainted with God,&rdquo; said Father
Jansen, &ldquo;must study diligently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Claus, &ldquo;the articles of
faith. You ought to hear my Femke repeat them. It&rsquo;s a pleasure,
isn&rsquo;t it, father? She&rsquo;s my only child,
but&mdash;she&rsquo;s a girl worth having!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Femke is an excellent girl. I don&rsquo;t have any
trouble with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The father spoke in a business-like manner; and he meant it that
way. The spots on Femke&rsquo;s soul were easily removed. He praised
Femke as a cook would praise a kitchen-pot.</p>

<p>Father Jansen had still more praise for Femke: she had patched his
drawers so nicely.</p>

<p>Oh, Fancy!</p>

<p>The mention of this fact did not touch Walter&rsquo;s &aelig;sthetic
feelings. With him there were other considerations. Fancy was used to
seeing everything nude&mdash;fathers, humanity&mdash;so there was no
difficulty here.</p>

<p>Walter was sixteen years old, already a little man&mdash;why must
Femke patch drawers for this father!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;Femke is clever at
patching. If you&rsquo;ve got anything else that needs mending, just
send it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was warm. If it had been collars, socks, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>waistcoats,
or&mdash;well, if it had to be something questionable&mdash;if it had
only been trousers!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just send it over, and if Femke isn&rsquo;t
here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she going to be?&rdquo; thought Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will attend to it myself. I can do it
neatly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thank God! Dear, good, magnificent Mrs. Claus! Do it, do it
yourself, and leave Femke where she is.</p>

<p>But&mdash;where was she?</p>

<p>Thus Walter&rsquo;s thoughts; but what did he say?&mdash;the
hypocrite, the budding man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, Mrs. Claus, I had almost forgotten to ask where
your daughter Femke is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Femke? She&rsquo;s at my niece&rsquo;s, where the girl is
sick. You know we&rsquo;re of good family. Femke is looking after my
niece&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter didn&rsquo;t have the courage to ask where this niece lived,
so he assumed a look of contentment.</p>

<p>After much waiting and twisting and turning on his chair, Walter
finally left the house with Father Jansen. He had not yet learned how
to end a visit: some people never learn it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to do me a favor?&rdquo; said the good
man. &ldquo;Then walk on my right side. I&rsquo;m deaf
here&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to his left ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you how it happened. When I was a little
boy&mdash;are you a good climber?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, M&rsquo;neer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am! In the whole of Vucht there wasn&rsquo;t a boy
who could climb as well as I could. Do you know what I did once? I
climbed up and slipped a flower-pot from a third-story window.
And&mdash;my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207">207</a>]</span>priest wasn&rsquo;t in a good humor at all! He
didn&rsquo;t want to accept me till I had returned that flower-pot; and
then I had to go and beg the old woman&rsquo;s pardon. And she herself
went to the priest to intercede for me. Then he accepted me. But I got
twenty &lsquo;confiteors&rsquo;&mdash;oh, he was severe!</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I was going to tell you why I&rsquo;m deaf in the left
ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In one of the seminaries was a student&mdash;he&rsquo;s a
canonicus in the Rhine country, and will get to be a cardinal, perhaps
pope, for&mdash;he was very sly! I will tell you, his name
was&mdash;Rake; but, you understand, his name was really something
else. This Rake was a mean rascal; but he was never punished, because
he was careful. See if he doesn&rsquo;t get to be a cardinal, or pope!
You ought to hear him quote from the Vulgate. He could rattle away for
three hours and never made a mistake.&rdquo; * * *</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you perfectly crazy, boy, or what is the matter with you?
Walking with a priest! What in the name of the Lord are you thinking
about? Go in the house&mdash;quick! Jesu, what troubles I have with
that child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words Juffrouw Pieterse broke off Walter&rsquo;s
acquaintance with Father Jansen for this time.</p>

<p>The way that the father and Walter had taken led them directly by
Walter&rsquo;s home. Juffrouw Pieterse, who was haggling with a Jew
over the price of a basket of potatoes, narrowly escaped a stroke of
apoplexy when she saw them together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a priest!&mdash;Stoffel! Come down quick&mdash;that boy
is walking with a priest!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208"
href="#pb208">208</a>]</span></p>

<p>Tears rose in Walter&rsquo;s eyes. He had found Father Jansen a good
man, and was grieved that that gentleman should meet with such a
reception.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that those rude words were received by his left
ear. In fact, this seemed to be the case, for when Walter said that he
was at home now and that his mother was calling him, Father Jansen
answered kindly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So? You live there? Then I will tell you the next time why I
am so deaf in my left ear&mdash;entirely deaf, you
understand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thank God, Walter thought, and wiped away his tears. In his eyes his
mother had committed a sin so grave that about fifty
&ldquo;confiteors&rdquo; would be necessary for its expiation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I was going to tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words Father Jansen turned around again. He continued:
&ldquo;The flower-pot of the old lady, Juffrouw Dungelaar, you
know&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t for the flowers, you understand, nor for the
pot, but only because I could climb so well. Otherwise&mdash;one
mustn&rsquo;t take anything away, even if it is so high up. <i>
Adieu</i>, young man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After giving Juffrouw Pieterse a friendly greeting that she did not
deserve, the man continued on his way.</p>

<p>Stoffel said that to walk with a priest was &ldquo;simply
preposterous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if he were crazy!&rdquo; said Juffrouw Pieterse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Stoffel, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s because he
has nothing to do but loaf around. If that keeps up, he will never
amount to anything.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209">209</a>]</span></p>

<p>True, Walter was loafing around; but he was not idle. His activities
brought nothing palpable to light, still he was building up the inner
life in a manner of which Stoffel had no idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;He must have work.
If he were only willing to be a compositor! or an apprentice in the
shoe-business. To make shoes&mdash;that he shall never do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This running with priests comes only from idleness, mother.
Do I run with priests? Never. Why not? Because I have to go to my
school every day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Stoffel, you go to your school every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, there are good priests. There was Luther, for
instance. He was a sort of priest. What did he do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. He reformed the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He made them Lutherans, mother; but that&rsquo;s almost the
same thing. One mustn&rsquo;t be narrow-minded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say, Stoffel, people ought not to be so
narrow-minded. What difference does it make what a person&rsquo;s
religion is, just so he&rsquo;s upright, and not a Roman
Catholic!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Walter told Father Jansen that he &ldquo;was in
business,&rdquo; and that he was &ldquo;going back to business,&rdquo;
he spoke better than he himself knew. He did go back to business.</p>

<p>Through a leather-dealer, who, speaking commercially, was in close
touch with shoes that came from Paris, Walter got a position with a
firm whose &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; was somewhat less apocryphal
than that of Messrs. Motto, Business &amp; Co. He was to begin his new
apprenticeship in the offices of Messrs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb210" href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>Ouwetyd &amp; Kopperlith, a firm
of world-wide reputation.</p>

<p>However, before he was to enter upon his new duties, all sorts of
things were destined to happen, with the tendency to make Walter appear
as a &ldquo;hero of romance,&rdquo; which he wasn&rsquo;t at all. <span

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXV</h2>

<p>It was Thursday. Stoffel came home with the important news that the
king&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what king&mdash;had arrived in the city
unexpectedly and would visit the theatre that evening. Everything and
everybody was in a commotion; for in republican countries much
importance is given to pomp and title.</p>

<p>This time curiosity was more wrought up than usual. Many foreign
princes, including an emperor, were visiting the king; and these
distinguished personages would follow the court to Amsterdam, coming
from The Hague, Utrecht and Haarlem. To put it tamely, it was to be a
great occasion.</p>

<p>That republican populace was to get to see the countenance and
coat-tails not only of their tyrant, but also the countenances and
coat-tails of many other tyrants, not to mention female tyrants.</p>

<p>The old doughnut women on the &ldquo;Dam,&rdquo; which the city
rented to them as a market-place, were threatening to bring suit
against the city. They felt that it was hard to have to pay rent for
the fresh air, day after day, with the prospect of selling a few
doughnuts to the youth of the street, and now be run out because his
majesty wanted to exhibit himself to the people from the balcony of the
old City Hall.</p>

<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t the old women be seen at their accustomed
places? Must the doughnut industry be carried on secretly? Was it for
fear of imitations and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212">212</a>]</span>unprincely competition? Or was it to keep the
old women from seeing the king?</p>

<p>At any rate, the whole kit of them had to leave. At most, they could
only mix with the crowd incognito, and afterwards might join in the
prearranged &ldquo;Long live the King!&rdquo; or somebody else, as the
case might be.</p>

<p>It is really remarkable that princes die. Seemingly the
&ldquo;vivats&rdquo; are of no avail.</p>

<p>The crowd was especially large, on account of the many majesties and
highnesses who had gathered about the tyrant.</p>

<p>Among the number was the Prince of Caramania, who had especial
claims upon the sympathy of the people, so all the newspapers said. One
of his ancestors had been a captain in the service of the state and
had, therefore, spilt his blood for the freedom of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>This blood, and perhaps the freedom as well, was newspaper
arabesque. It was certain, however, that the prince wore a green coat
with gold frogs; and upon his head he had a big plume. It was,
therefore, quite proper for the crowd to cry occasionally &ldquo;Long
live the Prince of Caramania!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the eminent gentlemen was a certain duke, who, by reason of
his virtues, had got himself banished from his country. The man was
thrifty and economical, though without neglecting himself.
Nevertheless, the rabble had dethroned him and sent him across the
border with a bushel of diamonds. Of these diamonds he was now to
display a few dozen in the shape of coat-buttons and the like. The
newspapers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=
"#pb213">213</a>]</span>gave the crowd their cue accordingly. They were
to cry: &ldquo;Long live the Duke with his diamonds!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Princess Erika was the niece of the king, and was to marry the
crown-prince of a great empire, which was indebted to the Netherlands
for its prominence. The newspapers gave the assurance that this empire
would pay off the national debt of the Netherlands if the people would
only put enough enthusiasm into a &ldquo;Long live Princess
Erika!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old Countess-palatine of Aetolia was descended directly from a
certain knight who treated his hostlers like princes. In this case it
was not inappropriate for a republican populace to ask for a
prolongation of her ladyship&rsquo;s life. The cry was: &ldquo;Long
live the Countess-palatine of Aetolia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Grand-duke of Ysland was the handsome grandson of a shopman. His
merits would fill three columns of fine print. The man was a master of
the type-case himself, and by exerting himself could even set up his
own name. The newspapers said that having safely passed an ocean of
pitfalls, he had now perfected himself as the brother-in-law of a
demi-god. Therefore, whoever had the interest of his country at heart
could not afford to fail to bellow at the top of his voice: &ldquo;Long
live the Grand-duke of Ysland!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were still more potentates and ladies of quality who had
honored Amsterdam with a visit. They had heard that the city was <i
lang="fr">la V&eacute;nise du Nord</i>, that it was <i lang="fr">tres
interessant, tres interessant</i>! etc.</p>

<p>And the Holland herrings! <i lang="fr">D&eacute;licieux!</i>
Unfortunately the Netherlanders didn&rsquo;t know how to cook them;
they must be baked. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href=
"#pb214">214</a>]</span></p>

<p>And the Holland school of painting! <i>
Rambr&agrave;nn&mdash;magnifique!</i></p>

<p>There were still other good things in Holland, as their highnesses
testified with patronizing kindness.</p>

<p lang="fr">&ldquo;Il parait qu&rsquo;un certain Wond&egrave;le a
&eacute;crit des choses, des choses&mdash;mais des
choses&mdash;passablement bien!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the dikes! And the Katwyk sluice&mdash;<i lang=
"fr">gigantesque</i>!</p>

<p>Whatever spare time they might have after making cheese and cooking
herrings, the Holland people liked to devote to fighting the elements.
After skating and racing this was the favorite recreation of the
nation.</p>

<p>I can assure the reader that the aristocratic party took their
departure thoroughly satisfied with our country. The only person who
received quite a different impression&mdash;but I will not anticipate
the feelings of our hero. Even a writer has his duties.</p>

<p>The first evening everything was to be illuminated. Two hundred and
fifty thousand candles were to proclaim the enthusiasm of the people.
Two hundred and fifty thousand fiery tongues were to cry:
&ldquo;Hosanna! Blessed be he who comes in the name
of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; In whose name? Hosanna for whom? For what?</p>

<p>Well, that was a matter of indifference to the people. They knew
that there was something doing, that there was a crowd, and that was
enough. People are somewhat like children, who amuse themselves
immensely in the confusion of a &ldquo;moving,&rdquo; of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>death, or of
anything that causes commotion and excitement.</p>

<p>Walter had got permission to see the illumination. Unconsciously he
assumed that stupid expression which is obligatory on such occasions.
He listened to the conversation of those about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call illuminating! Nine candles for such
a big house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve!&rdquo; cried another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three&mdash;three&mdash;three&mdash;and three. Look there are
twelve, or I can&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the three above don&rsquo;t count. That story is rented.
I know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;if you mean it that way. I only said that four
times three are twelve. What do you say, Hannes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hannes found the calculation correct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will the candles burn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Till about one o&rsquo;clock, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been in the Sukkelgracht?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t pretty there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think so? Prettier than here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look there; there&rsquo;s a verse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a verse. Can you read it?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216">216</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly! Let me see, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can read it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about &lsquo;illustrious
blood&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and &lsquo;our country,&rsquo; and &lsquo;dedicated to
honor and virtue.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And &lsquo;his illustrious
blood&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, there it stands&mdash;&lsquo;torn from the
barbarians&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That comes later. &lsquo;Illustrious
blood&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of Holland&rsquo;s hero&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, hero!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the king looks at the candles. Do you suppose he
reads such verses and copies them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he has his ministers for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or generals. He has seen or read about lots of nice
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As nice as here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I think? He likes to look at the lights
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t believe that.<span class="corr" id=
"xd0e4696" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crowd so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. They&rsquo;re crowding me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people are pushing and shoving as if they were
crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see the like? You know what I think? Kalver
Street ought to be as wide again as it is.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217">217</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, as wide again. The street&rsquo;s too narrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why everybody&rsquo;s scroudging so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was much truth in this. Pressure was high. People were mashed
and squeezed together. Those who, by reason of a lack of avoirdupois,
were less firmly attached to the ground, were lifted bodily. Walter
hung suspended in mid-air and looked over the heads of men much taller
than he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you walking on stilts?&rdquo; asked a big fat woman,
whose hips had come into collision with Walter&rsquo;s knees.
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pressure was increasing. It seemed that the fat woman would soon
have Walter on her shoulder, like a gun; while Walter was thinking that
soon he would be roaming over the country like a knight. No one was
looking at the candles now. People were finding their amusement in
crowding and being crowded.</p>

<p>No, Kalver Street ought not to be widened. For, properly understood,
this crowding and pushing and shoving was the nicest part of the whole
business.</p>

<p>How tedious it would have been quietly to watch those two hundred
and fifty thousand candles from some comfortable position.</p>

<p>Our little man lay on the heads and shoulders of his brothers. Like
some aspirants to a throne, he threw himself upon the masses. But he
was beginning to feel generally uncomfortable. He wanted to hold on
fast to something, or somebody&mdash;to somebody&rsquo;s ears, or nose.
That, however, did not suit the masses. They didn&rsquo;t mind being
squeezed; but they didn&rsquo;t like to be held on to. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218">218</a>]</span></p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let the reader be alarmed. Walter had not burst under
the strain; but the pressure of the crowd had broken in the double
doors of a caf&eacute;! The irruption was terrible. The way the crowd
streamed in might be compared to the flow of molten lava. Walter
described a <span class="corr" id="xd0e4729" title="Source: parobolic">
parabolic</span> curve and landed on a table, without suffering any
damage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walter Pieterse!&rdquo; cried the astonished party sitting
around the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you hurt yourself, Walter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, he hadn&rsquo;t hurt himself; but he was rigid with surprise.
Firstly, over his ascent; secondly, over his a&euml;rial journey; then
over his descent among all kinds of glassware; and, finally&mdash;and
that was not the least surprising thing&mdash;he was surprised to find
himself all at once in the bosom of the Holsma family.</p>

<p>It was Sietske who asked him if he was hurt.</p>

<p>All the glasses, both great and small, were broken; but Walter was
still in one piece. Uncle Sybrand helped him to his feet. It
wasn&rsquo;t easy, for the press was great. However, Walter&rsquo;s
size facilitated matters.</p>

<p>The proprietor couldn&rsquo;t reach the scene of action, but he was
able to make his voice heard to the effect that everything broken must
be paid for. From other tables came the noise of more breaking glass.
The man was desperate. He cursed kings and masses indiscriminately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One bottle of wine, three lemonades, six glasses!&rdquo;
cried Holsma, assuming the responsibility for Walter&rsquo;s
unintentional work of destruction. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219"
href="#pb219">219</a>]</span></p>

<p>Uncle Sybrand was holding up the money to pay for everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, M&rsquo;neer, I&rsquo;m afraid to go home after
this,&rdquo; cried Walter. &ldquo;How can I pay for that? And my
mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the noise and jumble Holsma did not understand; but Sietske
understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Papa will pay for it all.
Besides, I have money; and William, too; and Hermann. Just be
quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter still did not understand. When, under the protection of the
Holsmas, he was safe on the outside again, and the entire party had
escaped the mob by taking a side street, he reiterated that he did dare
show his face to his mother and Stoffel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference about the money,&rdquo;
said Holsma. &ldquo;I will attend to that. Why, boy, you&rsquo;re
scared half to death. You&rsquo;re shaking. Come along home with us
where you can rest a bit and quiet yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The distance, however, proved too short to have the desired quieting
effect on Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother will be angry when I come home late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holsma told him that a messenger should be sent to his mother at
once, so that she would know where he was.</p>

<p>The doctor gave him a sedative and led him into a room adjoining
that in which the Holsma family were sitting. Walter was to walk up and
down the room till he felt better; but he soon got tired of this and
did the very thing that he was not to do; he sat down on a sofa and
fell asleep. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href=
"#pb220">220</a>]</span></p>

<p>Whether, in general, it is a good thing to keep in motion after a
fright&mdash;that I do not know. Walter, on the contrary, always felt
the need of sleep under such circumstances; and this remedy, with which
nature provided him, usually restored his mental equilibrium. Perhaps,
after all, it wasn&rsquo;t real sleep: he merely dreamed.</p>

<p>Again he was lifted up, higher and higher, borne by strong hands. A
man bit him in the hand. The fact was he had scratched his hand on a
refractory horsehair, which had become tired of acting as stuffing for
a sofa-pillow.</p>

<p>An angry woman assailed him with abuse. Stupid? Not stupid? We, the
masses? She let him fall. But he fell in Sietske&rsquo;s lap; and there
wasn&rsquo;t a single sliver of glassware.</p>

<p>He was happy&mdash;but the horsehair scratched him again. Then he
heard a voice. Was he still dreaming? Yes, dreaming again of soaring
and falling. There was Femke.</p>

<p>Of course there had to be something about her in his dream, and
about bleaching the clothes. Father Jansen was there, too, exhibiting
to the stars the particular garment that Femke had patched. Orion and
the Great Bear admired this specimen of her handiwork. Walter did
not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you do it yourself?&rdquo; he heard <span class="corr"
id="xd0e4780" title="Source: Sietska">Sietske</span> asking in the next
room. &ldquo;Or couldn&rsquo;t you get through the crowd?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it was impossible to get through such a mob. I turned it
over to the man with the peddler&rsquo;s wagon.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221">221</a>]</span></p>

<p>What was that? Walter sat up. Father Jansen was gone; Orion, too;
and the clouds, and the &ldquo;masses&rdquo;; but&mdash;that voice!</p>

<p>He heard it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know him very well&mdash;oh, so well! He&rsquo;s a good
boy.&rdquo; This he heard Femke say!</p>

<p>He jumped up and ran into the room where the Holsmas were. He saw a
triangular piece of a woman&rsquo;s dress disappear through the door;
then the door closed.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t have the courage&mdash;or was something else beside
courage necessary to ask, &ldquo;Is that Femke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On his way home that evening Walter did not suffer in the least from
the sensation of being borne through the air; or from anything similar.
He was on the earth, very much on the earth. He felt lowly.</p>

<p>If he had only seen that bit of Femke&rsquo;s dress somewhere else,
and not at the Holsmas&mdash;not in that swell family; not in the
company of Sietske, who had so much money in her
&ldquo;savings-bank,&rdquo; nor in the presence of the vain William,
who was studying Latin!</p>

<p>He was brave enough to feel ashamed of himself; and that&rsquo;s all
I can say in his favor.</p>

<p>Let us now look at things from the point of view of Juffrouw
Pieterse. That lady was in the clouds. She was hoping that the
messenger who had brought her news of Walter had not been able to find
her flat at once. The idea of someone from Dr. Holsma&rsquo;s asking
for her through the neighborhood was decidedly pleasant. The longer he
might have had to inquire for her the better!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he was at the grocer&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href=
"#pb222">222</a>]</span>&ldquo;Such messengers never know where they
have to go. Of course he told that the &lsquo;young gentleman&rsquo;
was staying at Dr. Holsma&rsquo;s! And such a man always tattles; such
people don&rsquo;t do anything but tattle. But, as far as I&rsquo;m
concerned, everybody can know it. I only mean that such people like to
tattle. But&mdash;say, Walter, how did it happen that you went with the
family? You&rsquo;re a nice rascal. Stoffel, what do you
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel made a serious face&mdash;as much as to say: &ldquo;Hm!
I&rsquo;ll have to think over it. He&rsquo;s been up to
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met the Holsma family in Kalver Street,&rdquo; Walter said.
He told the truth; he had met the family in Kalver Street. But why
didn&rsquo;t he tell anything about the extraordinary circumstances
under which he met them? Ah&mdash;there&rsquo;s the rub!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your back is so sticky!&rdquo; complained Pietro, whose care
it was to look after the washing.</p>

<p>The family rubbed, and felt, and smelt; and then they declared
unanimously that Walter&rsquo;s back had been guilty of absorbing all
kinds of sticky gases and liquids.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, it smells like lemon,&rdquo; said Trudie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And like wine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s just coated with sugar. Boy, where have you
been? Don&rsquo;t you have any sense of shame? To go to visit such
swell people with lemon and sugar on your back! It&rsquo;s a disgrace,
a disgrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was such a crowd on the street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That don&rsquo;t explain the wine on your back&mdash;nor the
lemon&mdash;nor the sugar. What say you, Trudie?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223">223</a>]</span></p>

<p>There was complete unanimity. Timid, as usual, Walter didn&rsquo;t
have the courage to tell everything. Nor would this have done any good.
The understanding of the Pieterse family was like a rusty lock that no
key will open. Walter knew this, and remembering former sad
experiences, allowed the storm to rage above his head. Unfortunately
he, too, in a sense, was rusty. His nobility of character had suffered;
he had been guilty of cowardice.</p>

<p>He felt it. No minister could pray it away. Not even God himself
could revoke it. Everyone must act according to his conviction, Mevrouw
Holsma had said. He had not done this.</p>

<p>A dog would have kissed the hem of Femke&rsquo;s garment, meeting
her after such a long separation. For it was she. Certainly it was
Femke&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh, he was hunting for or&rsquo;s!</p>

<p>Could it have been somebody else? It must have been somebody else.
How could Femke be at Dr. Holsma&rsquo;s?</p>

<p>No, no, it was she! Didn&rsquo;t she say that she knew me?
Didn&rsquo;t she speak with the same voice that I heard when she called
me a dear boy and gave me the kiss at the bridge?</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t know then what a coward I am! She wouldn&rsquo;t
deny me and betray me. She would say to everybody: That is Walter, my
little friend that I kissed that time, because he was so brave in
fighting off those boys!</p>

<p>And I? Oh, help me God!</p>

<p>No, God has nothing to do with it. I am a coward. I can&rsquo;t live
this way. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href=
"#pb224">224</a>]</span></p>

<p>He thought of suicide; and in this mood he spent that Thursday
night. He arose Friday morning with the firm determination to put an
end to his unworthy existence.</p>

<p>Fortunately, just after breakfast he was put to work on a job that
is calculated to reconcile one with life.</p>

<p>He had been tried and convicted, the verdict being unanimous. The
penalty was that he should wash his jacket till it was clean. He
entered upon the task with such enthusiasm that in an hour he was
running to his mother crying triumphantly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, mother! You can&rsquo;t see a trace of it
now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This little conquest dispelled all the clouds that had darkened his
life.</p>

<p>There are plenty of people who would gladly fall into a barrel of
lemonade if they only understood the salutary effects of cleaning a
coat.</p>

<p>The poor unfortunate who has never washed his own clothes does not
know what life is.</p>

<p>I will ask her pardon, thought Walter; and he pictured it all to
himself, wondering whether it would do for him to fall at her feet at
Holsma&rsquo;s, in the presence of the one who had delivered the
message. Finally, however, he quieted himself with the thought that
Femke would probably not be at the doctor&rsquo;s very long. He hoped
to be able then to settle the matter quietly, when only the two
concerned were present. This was not courageous, to be sure; but his
punishment was already on the way. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225"

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXVI</h2>

<p>The events of an eventful Friday were at an end, as it seemed; and
Walter prepared to climb into the narrow bedstead, which he shared with
his brother Laurens. He was now in a tranquil frame of mind. He
didn&rsquo;t even have any desire to romp with Laurens, who, without
laying claim to geometrical knowledge, usually managed to find the
diagonal of the bed.</p>

<p>It was Walter&rsquo;s intention to think over recent events again.
He wished to busy himself with others; he was tired of himself&mdash;at
least he thought so for a moment.</p>

<p>There was a prince, who distributed money among the people. Oh, if I
were only a prince!</p>

<p>That wasn&rsquo;t a bad thought. Under the same circumstances, most
people would have thought: Oh, if I could only have got some of the
money!</p>

<p>The countess-palatine from&mdash;where from? Well it makes no
difference. She was in the museum and the papers said she was gracious,
very gracious.</p>

<p>I would do it too, thought Walter, if I were a countess-palatine.
What sort of a profession is that?</p>

<p>The king had given audiences&mdash;and a dinner&mdash;and had
said&mdash;well, the usual things. But for Walter it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>was new and
interesting. The welfare of the city seemed to lie heavily on his
majesty&rsquo;s heart. It lay heavily on Walter&rsquo;s heart, too; but
that did not prevent Walter from admiring this peculiarity of the king.
In Africa he would do the same thing.</p>

<p>No, away with Africa!</p>

<p>He threw off his left stocking so violently that it curled around
the leg of the chair like a dying earthworm.</p>

<p>What strange things he had heard of Princess Erika! It was said that
she was to have married a grand-duke, but rejected him.</p>

<p>The middle classes were delighted with this news; though not knowing
but that it might merely have been stubbornness on the part of the
princess.</p>

<p>She was of such a strange nature that she did not know how to behave
herself in her high position.</p>

<p>Walter slipped off his other stocking, finding fault with the
princess for disregarding the usual customs and conventions. Hm! He
wondered if she would like to change places with him, and let him be
Prince Erich&mdash;and she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He wondered if she too wore an ugly nightcap. But&mdash;no!
Princesses would wear caps of diamonds.</p>

<p>Princess Erika!</p>

<p>Walter blew out the light&mdash;no, he was on the point of blowing
it out. He had selected one of the triangles that Laurens had described
in the bed, when suddenly he became aware of a great tumult in the
Pieterse home.</p>

<p>Yes, somebody had rung violently three or four times and was still
banging at the door. Fire? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href=
"#pb227">227</a>]</span></p>

<p>Hm! Could it be Princess Erika, he thought, who was coming to change
places with him?</p>

<p>Alas, it was only Juffrouw Laps; and she did not come to
exchange.</p>

<p>Well, what did she want then, so late in the evening?</p>

<p>Walter pulled himself together and listened.</p>

<p>The compartment where Walter and Laurens slept was a boxed-up
arrangement over the sitting-room. Two of their sisters shared the
space with them. From considerations of modesty, therefore, the boys
always had to get sleepy a quarter of an hour before the young
ladies.</p>

<p>The writer is unable to say how much oxygen four <span class="corr"
id="xd0e4915" title="Source: family, the female part, of course, was
still in the">young people need during eight hours without
suf</span>focating; but anyway there wasn&rsquo;t much room in this
little nook.</p>

<p>In another closet-affair there was a similar division, and here,
too, the hour for retiring was determined by similar laws of
modesty.</p>

<p>The reader will now understand why a part of the family, the female
part of course, was still in the sitting-room when Walter imagined that
Princess Erika had come to exchange places with him.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps, who had rushed up the steps like a crazy woman, burst
into the room weeping and moaning and sobbing.</p>

<p>The usual cries of, &ldquo;What on earth is the matter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lord &rsquo;a&rsquo; mercy&mdash;what has happened?&rdquo; were
forthcoming. Walter noticed, too, that the customary glass of water was
offered and drunk, and that proper efforts were being made to get the
unhappy one to &ldquo;calm herself.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb228" href="#pb228">228</a>]</span></p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps began her story with the positive assurance that it
was impossible for her to utter a word.</p>

<p>It seemed, therefore, that the affair was something important.
Walter pulled on one of his stockings and prepared to listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear, Juffrouw Pieterse, by the omnipotent God, that
I&rsquo;m so frightened and excited that I can&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are your children? In bed? Not all of them, I hope.
Really, I can&rsquo;t speak. Give me another glass of water, Trudie.
Listen, how my teeth are chattering. That comes from fright,
doesn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;m in a tremble all over. Thank you, Trudie.
Where&rsquo;s&mdash;Stoffel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s undressing,&rdquo; said Juffrouw Pieterse.
&ldquo;He goes to bed before me and Pietro. Mina makes so much noise,
you know; and Trudie must stay with the boys to keep them from
fighting. That&rsquo;s why I sleep with Pietro, you see. Stoffel
undresses himself, and then he draws the curtain when he hears us on
the steps. But why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How that concerns me, you mean? To be sure. I&rsquo;m just
beside myself from fright! And is&mdash;Laurens in bed too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! A long time already. He has to go to the
printing-house early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All in bed! And I&mdash;I run through the streets, wretched,
crazy, and don&rsquo;t know what to do. Is everybody in
bed?&mdash;everybody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what has happened?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb229" href="#pb229">229</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you, Juffrouw Pieterse. Oh, if you
only knew how frightened I am!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Consideration of acoustics now led Walter to put on his other
stocking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Juffrouw Pieterse, that of late so much stealing
has been going on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And burglary and murder! And the police can&rsquo;t catch
anybody. You know the old woman and the servant-girl who were murdered
in Lommer Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But three are already behind the bars for it. What more do
you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right; the murderers are running around
scot-free. They&rsquo;ve locked up three fellows just to keep the
people from thinking too much. They don&rsquo;t want anybody to ask,
&lsquo;What are the police for?&rsquo; You see what I mean? I tell you
that such a low-down rascal, who commits a murder and steals lots of
money, cannot hide his bloody clothes; nor the money, either.
He&rsquo;s not used to having so much money. All the neighbors know his
coat and breeches; and such a man hasn&rsquo;t any trunk where he can
hide his things. He doesn&rsquo;t know how to manage with drafts and
notes; and he don&rsquo;t know enough to get away to a foreign country.
As for friends to help him get rid of the stolen things, he
hasn&rsquo;t any. I tell you, Juffrouw Pieterse, a murder or a robbery,
when they don&rsquo;t catch the murderer right away&mdash;then some
respectable person has done it, who has more clothes and boxes and
presses and linen&mdash;and he has friends among bankers. A common
fellow would stick a hundred thousand florins in the bread-box, and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href=
"#pb230">230</a>]</span>children would find it when they went to slip a
slice of bread and butter. What do you say, Trudie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trudie was not versed in criminal statistics and had never reflected
on the matter. At least Walter heard no answer. Curiosity compelled him
to draw on his trousers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he heard his mother saying again, &ldquo;what has
happened to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened? I am beside myself. Don&rsquo;t you see
how I&rsquo;m trembling? The city is full of murderers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goodness! How can I help it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t. But I am beside myself, and I want to ask
your advice. Do they all go to bed so early?&mdash;Stoffel&mdash;and
Laurens&mdash;all of them? Look, how I&rsquo;m shaking. Do you suppose
I dare go back to my room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? Do you think you&rsquo;re going to be
murdered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I do think it! The murderers of that old woman and of
the servant-girl are still on the war-path. Yesterday at the
illumination how many watches did they steal? And the police&mdash;what
do they do? Nothing, nothing! Yes, they watch you to see if you beat a
rug in the morning after ten o&rsquo;clock. That&rsquo;s what the
police do. They don&rsquo;t bother murderers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you know about the murderers? It&rsquo;s your duty to
report them if you know them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter put on his vest and wrapped his muffler around his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I know about them! They are besieging <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>me in my own
house. Isn&rsquo;t that pretty rough? I went out at noon to see the
boat race on the Amstel; but there was nothing to see, because there
was no wind. And such a crowd! All the kings were there, and the
visiting princes and princesses, you know; and everybody stared at the
carriages, and I did too. Not that I care anything about a king.
Goodness, no! For he is only a worm in God&rsquo;s hand, and when the
Master doesn&rsquo;t aid him&mdash;all is vanity, vanity. Dust and
ashes&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. But I looked at the carriages, you know,
and at the horses, and at the staring crowd. I thought to myself, I
will fry the potatoes when I go home. They had been left over from
dinner; and when there are any potatoes left over, you know, I always
fry them for supper. There was a big crowd, and all were mad because
there was no wind; for people are foolish about pleasure and never
think of the Master. Worldly, worldly, they were&mdash;and the princes
and princesses. I thought, well, it&rsquo;s no wonder that
there&rsquo;s so much robbery and murder; for they try God&rsquo;s
patience. I thought, God will punish you; He&rsquo;s only abiding His
time. He always does it, Juffrouw Pieterse! A lady&mdash;the creature
had red pimples on her face, and was older than you&mdash;what do you
suppose she had on her head? A turban! She rode in a carriage with four
horses. What do you think of that? She was playing with a fan; and,
when a prince rode up to her carriage, she stuck out her hand and let
the fan go up and down three times. And the prince did that way three
times. Were they crazy, or not? What will the Master say to that? If He
only doesn&rsquo;t send a pestilence on us!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232">232</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the murderers&mdash;what did they do to
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly&mdash;what they did? I am going to tell you.
I&rsquo;m still trembling. I had sliced my potatoes, put them on a
saucer and set them away in the cupboard. Then I thought, I will fry
them when I come home; for I didn&rsquo;t expect to stay long in the
crowd, for I have been saved by grace and don&rsquo;t care for worldly
things&mdash;ah, dear Juffrouw Pieterse, you must call Stoffel, so he
can hear what has happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel was already on his way down; and Walter was glad of it.
Walter had heard the noise Stoffel was making putting on his clothes in
the adjoining booth, and upon this he builded hopes that he too might
be allowed to go down, where he could hear the exciting story better
than was possible through the cracks in the floor. In the meantime he
had completely dressed himself. The noises below told him of
Stoffel&rsquo;s arrival in the sitting-room. He heard the usual
greetings and Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s solemn assurance that she was still
in such a tremble that she couldn&rsquo;t say a word. Then he heard her
ask immediately where Laurens was.</p>

<p>Laurens? Well, he was asleep.</p>

<p>That youth&rsquo;s absence seemed to trouble the visitor. She
couldn&rsquo;t proceed. Was it really necessary for Laurens to be
present?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Stoffel? Isn&rsquo;t the city full of
thieves and murderers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel drew in his upper lip and tried to make the lower one touch
his nose. Let the reader try the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233"
href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>same; then he will know how Stoffel
answered, and what his answer meant.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps pretended to believe that he had said
&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Stoffel says so too! The city is full of
thieves and murderers, and&mdash;a respectable person is afraid to go
to bed alone any more. It&rsquo;s just that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;Juffrouw!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The police? Nonsense! What good do the police do, when people
don&rsquo;t believe in God? That&rsquo;s the truth. Whoever
doesn&rsquo;t do that is lost. Human help&mdash;I cannot understand at
all why Laurens goes to bed so early. You surely know that so much
sleep isn&rsquo;t good for anybody. What does the Bible say? Watch and
pray! But&mdash;everyone according to his notion. I swear before God
that I don&rsquo;t dare to go home alone and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter&rsquo;s curiosity was at high tension. In order to hear
better he was leaning over, supporting himself with the chair. The
point of support was unsteady. The chair slipped and rattled across the
floor, crashing into another piece of furniture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven and earth! What are they up to now,&rdquo; groaned the
mother. &ldquo;Laurens, is that you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter peeped in, &ldquo;It was me.&rdquo; The result was that he
was soon in the midst of the interesting conversation that he had been
trying to hear from above.</p>

<p>His entrance took place under unfavorable circumstances. He was
blamed for not having been undressed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb234" href="#pb234">234</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you always put on your nightcap before you undress?&rdquo;
cried the mother.</p>

<p>The boy had actually forgotten to take off his nightcap. He was so
ashamed that he felt he would like to fall through the floor. He would
rather have neglected anything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;what have you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alas, our hero looked more ridiculous than anyone could look by
simply putting on a nightcap. He had armed himself with an old rusty
knife that his father had used in prehistoric times for cutting
leather!</p>

<p>During the whole of the Laps recital, which progressed so slowly, he
had thought and hoped and intended&mdash;yes, he heard something that
sounded like, &ldquo;Where is Walter?&rdquo; The speaker really did not
say it&mdash;no, on the contrary, those were the very words she wished
to avoid&mdash;still, he thought he heard her say them. On this Friday
he had acted mean and cowardly; but he was still Walter.</p>

<p>Murderers? Thieves? A lady in danger? What other answer could there
be but: &ldquo;I am here, I, Walter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, fate, why did you put that sword in his hand and let him forget
to remove that nightcap? Why didn&rsquo;t you divide these two
absurdities between Stoffel and Walter! Or why couldn&rsquo;t you put
that feathery diadem on the head of the sleeping Laurens? It would have
been all the same to him how he looked in his sleep.</p>

<p>Walter was in a rage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href=
"#pb235">235</a>]</span></p>

<p>And I am, too. Towards Femke his chivalry had remained in the
background; and now it must burst forth at a doubtful call from
Juffrouw Laps!</p>

<p>In his anger he threw the weapon down violently and allowed it to
rebound across the room. He slapped the nightcap on the table.</p>

<p>No one would have thought that the little man could be so vehement.
His mother, with her usual solicitousness, inquired into the condition
of his mind, asking if he was only cracked, or downright crazy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said the visitor, &ldquo;you ought not to
worry that child so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to bed at once!&rdquo; cried the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you let the child stay here? But&mdash;oh,
yes! I was going to tell you about my potatoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter stayed. For this privilege he was indebted to the general
curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just imagine, when I came home about half past ten
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t get away earlier on account of the
crush, you know. Don&rsquo;t you know, I don&rsquo;t care for these big
occasions. Well, when I got home&mdash;the city is full of thieves,
murderers, and that must not be forgotten&mdash;well, my potatoes
were&mdash;what do you think my potatoes were? They
were&mdash;gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your potatoes&mdash;gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My potatoes&mdash;all completely gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"
href="#pb236">236</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you those thieves and murderers did it. Who else could
have done it? Thieves and murderers in my house! And I wanted to ask
you&mdash;for I&rsquo;m afraid in my room&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter&rsquo;s eyes fairly shone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to ask, if perhaps&mdash;your son
Stoffel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel&rsquo;s face was a study, a curiosity. If the said thieves
and murderers could have seen it they would have been greatly pleased,
for it bore evidence of Stoffel&rsquo;s intention to leave them
undisturbed in their work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Juffrouw,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you a cat
in your room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cat? A cat to fight murderers with!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Juffrouw, not to fight murderers; but a cat that might
have eaten the potatoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about a cat. I only know that the
city is full of low-down people when so many murders are committed and
no one tries to catch the murderers. Not that I am anxious about my
life&mdash;no, not at all. When the Master calls me I shall say,
&lsquo;Let thy daughter go in peace; my eyes have seen thy
glory.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, woman, why didn&rsquo;t you look in your closet, and
under the bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to do that, Juffrouw Pieterse! The Lord
will take care of me&mdash;but one must not try the Lord&rsquo;s
patience. I would not go in the closet, or look under the bed&mdash;not
for everything in the world! For of course he&rsquo;s there, and
that&rsquo;s why I wanted to ask if <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb237" href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>your son&mdash;Stoffel, or, if
Stoffel doesn&rsquo;t want to, if perhaps your son&mdash;Laurens,
or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Juffrouw, why didn&rsquo;t you call the
neighbors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus spoke Stoffel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The neighbors? Well, I guess they know about it. The man who
lives under me is afraid of a poodle-dog, not to mention a murderer.
There&rsquo;s a man living next to me; but, you know, he is&mdash;what
shall I say&mdash;he is a sort of bachelor, and I don&rsquo;t want to
get talked about. You know a woman must always think of her reputation,
and not get mixed up in gossip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did not occur to anyone to ask what sort of a creature Stoffel
was. Was he a bachelor? Or did his position as a teacher protect him
against any worldly suspicion?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, besides,&rdquo; continued the seductive Laps, &ldquo;do
you think all men have courage? No! They&rsquo;re as afraid of a thief
as they are of death. Last week an insolent beggar was on the steps,
and the fellow wouldn&rsquo;t leave. Do you think the men did anything
to him? Scared to death! But, I tell you, I got hold of him in a hurry
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had gone too far, and she saw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I would have done that if I hadn&rsquo;t been a woman;
for a <span class="corr" id="xd0e5104" title="Source: women">
woman</span> must never use violence. It isn&rsquo;t becoming. What do
you say, Trudie? I ran and shut my door. Wasn&rsquo;t that right? No,
none of the men-folk has any courage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of the men-folk! Walter felt insulted. He was swelling with
suppressed courage; he was eager <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238"
href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>for a fray. At least, he was eager to show
that he was an exception to Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s general indictment.
Of course Juffrouw Laps noticed this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if Stoffel doesn&rsquo;t want
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if Laurens is already asleep&mdash;and if&mdash;if no one
else will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose I must, relying upon God, go alone. But
it&rsquo;s horrible for a woman to be entirely alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at them all in turn, all except the one she was talking
to. Walter felt that he was being forgotten, or overlooked. This only
increased his latent courage and made him burn with a desire to be
numbered with the knighthood of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if there&rsquo;s nobody here who&rsquo;s not
afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All but Juffrouw Laps were surprised. She was a good psychologist,
and had not expected anything else. It was her part, however, to
pretend to be as much surprised as any of the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Walter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, are you crazy? You?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I. I&rsquo;m not afraid; not if there were ten in the
closet and a hundred under the bed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little Luther! But with a difference. Luther had a God in whom he
felt he could trust&mdash;reinforced by a few grand-dukes. Walter,
without any grand-dukes, was ready to enter the field against a God who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>was
allowing any number of murderers to take shelter under the roof and bed
of Juffrouw Laps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him go, Juffrouw Pieterse. You
understand&mdash;it&rsquo;s company for me to have such a child with
me. Then I&rsquo;m not frightened so badly, if a murderer is in the
closet. Nobody wants to be entirely alone. Isn&rsquo;t that
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps gained her point: Walter was permitted to go with
her.</p>

<p>It was principally their vanity that caused the Pieterses to consent
so readily to Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s request and allow her to take
Walter away to act as her castellan. Not one of them felt that it was a
good thing for Walter to go with the Juffrouw; but they were all proud
of his courage. The story would get noised abroad, and people would
pass it on to their friends. Juffrouw Pieterse would see to it that the
people knew it was &ldquo;the same young gentlemen, you know, that went
home with Dr. Holsma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, and then people would say: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in
those Pieterse children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mothers like to hear such things.</p>

<p>With his package under his arm Walter marched away with Juffrouw
Laps to do battle for that pious lady. That prehistoric weapon he left
behind, on her assuring him that she had a well-filled store of weapons
and ammunition enough to kill all the murderers that he would have
occasion to contend with. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXVII</h2>

<p>Walter shuddered as he crossed Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s threshold. He
reflected, and wondered how he could have entered upon this knightly
expedition without considering certain details connected with it and
inseparable from it.</p>

<p>The first thing she offered him, of course, was the fried potatoes,
that dainty dish which the murderers had greedily made <span class=
"corr" id="xd0e5165" title="Source: way">away</span> with!</p>

<p>Walter was beginning to feel that the game wasn&rsquo;t worth the
candle. The adventure didn&rsquo;t offer sufficient outlet for his
chivalry. In fact, he thought something other than chivalry was
necessary to face single-handed and alone those fried potatoes and
Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s persistent attentions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make yourself at home and eat all you want. Don&rsquo;t be a
bit embarrassed. Or would you rather take off your coat first? You
know, you&rsquo;re to stay all night with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter preferred to keep on his coat for the present.</p>

<p><span class="corr" id="xd0e5175" title="Not in source">
&ldquo;</span>And I have a dram for you, too, my boy&mdash;something
extra. It&rsquo;s from Fockink&rsquo;s. You know where he has his
distillery, there in that narrow street. You must never pass along
there. Bad women live in that street. They stand at the doors and
windows, don&rsquo;t you know; and that isn&rsquo;t good for a bachelor
like you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241">241</a>]</span></p>

<p>Walter, the &ldquo;bachelor,&rdquo; looked surprised. He was
abashed; though he was not displeased. This promotion was more
flattering than going into &ldquo;business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still, he was embarrassed. Juffrouw Laps found it desirable,
therefore, to continue along this line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Walter, you&rsquo;re a bachelor. Don&rsquo;t you
know that? It&rsquo;s only because at home they treat you like a child.
I tell you, you&rsquo;re a bachelor, just as much so as anybody else.
Do you think I like Stoffel as well as I do you? No, no, no! Not a bit
of it! I like you lots better. Don&rsquo;t you want a pipe to smoke?
You are man enough for that. Of course you are; and why shouldn&rsquo;t
you smoke a pipe like other men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Men, men!</p>

<p>Walter answered that he couldn&rsquo;t smoke yet. It cost him an
effort to make the admission; but his first attempt to equal Stoffel in
that respect had turned out badly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So? You don&rsquo;t smoke?&rdquo; She omitted his
&ldquo;yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a good thing. It&rsquo;s a stupid habit in
men. And forever the terrible smoke! I know other young gentlemen who
do not smoke. For instance, there is Piet Hammel. He&rsquo;s as old as
you, but a little smaller. He&rsquo;s going to marry a cousin of mine;
and he doesn&rsquo;t smoke either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter felt better now. He was interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re going to get married about&mdash;well, I
don&rsquo;t know exactly when. But they intend to marry. I tell you,
you are a real bachelor; and it&rsquo;s awfully stupid of them still to
treat you like a child. I&rsquo;ve told your mother so a hundred times.
There on the street <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href=
"#pb242">242</a>]</span>just now, when we were together&mdash;I&rsquo;m
a delicate woman; but do you think I was afraid?&mdash;with you with
me? Not a bit. Not a trace of fear. And why? Because everybody could
see that I had a man with me. I ought to have taken hold of your
arm&mdash;you&rsquo;re almost taller than I am&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t
do it because you had a package. And then&mdash;the people talk so
much! The watchman might have seen it, and he would have spread the
news broadcast that I had been seen at night with a
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a gentleman! Walter was listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman must always think of her reputation. But we&rsquo;re
here at home now, and that&rsquo;s very different, entirely different.
I know that of course you wouldn&rsquo;t tell anything bad about me.
Whoever tells anything bad on a woman isn&rsquo;t a true gentleman. You
know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, Walter knew it. He understood Juffrouw Laps better than she
imagined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I wanted to say was, you must never go through that
street. So long as you were a child, it made no difference. But now!
Let me fill your glass for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter drank.</p>

<p>O Fancy, my muse, where art thou?</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter owned that the liquor had a pleasant taste.</p>

<p>Satan&rsquo;s handmaid filled the glasses again. They were &ldquo;so
small,&rdquo; really &ldquo;mere thimbles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you must eat something, dearest. Oh, I have always
thought so much of you! It&rsquo;s good for you to have a little dram
like that.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href=
"#pb243">243</a>]</span></p>

<p>Walter began to eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just take off your coat; there&rsquo;s nobody here but
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quite so. Walter did take off his coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to sit close to you, for you are a dear,
good, sweet boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fancy, Fancy!</p>

<p>The liquor was strong, and Walter drank more of it than was good for
him. He lost some of his modesty, and hardly knew what he was saying to
the talkative Juffrouw, as she asked questions from time to time. She
was not quite satisfied with the way things were going, but hoped for
the best.</p>

<p>Occasionally Walter found time to wonder why he was there, what the
purpose of the enforced visit might be. His hostess seemed to have
forgotten all about those thieves and murderers; and when he reminded
her of them, she showed a spirit of valor that did him good. For he and
his valor were undone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do them! Do you think I&rsquo;m afraid of such a
fellow? Well, I guess not. Not afraid of three of them. I
wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of ten of them&mdash;I&rsquo;m not afraid of
the whole world. I will do them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the better, thought Walter; for then he wouldn&rsquo;t have to
&ldquo;do&rdquo; them.</p>

<p>They now heard something rustling around in the closet, or else they
imagined they heard something. Walter was frightened. He was a perfect
child again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay here, and I will see what it is,&rdquo; cried the
Juffrouw. &ldquo;Do you think I would let them beat you, or stab you,
or murder you, my boy! Never! Whoever <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb244" href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>touches you will have to walk over
me. But I will give them all they need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went out, taking the light with her, to see what was the
matter&mdash;if anything. She was careful to leave Walter in the dark
long enough for him to wish for her return. The tables were being
turned. A little more, and the boy would seek protection under her
apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Juffrouw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will let you call me Christine. That&rsquo;s my
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was too much for Walter. He preferred to avoid addressing her
directly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But hadn&rsquo;t I better go home now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. You don&rsquo;t want to leave me, do you? You
know your mother is in bed asleep now. Besides, it was understood that
you were to spend the night here and take breakfast with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Breakfast! The boy hadn&rsquo;t been doing anything else for an
hour. Was that to continue till morning?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what! Just undress yourself; and you
needn&rsquo;t be a bit ashamed before me. I will make down a pallet for
you there in the corner. When I&rsquo;m here alone&mdash;just a
woman&mdash;with all the thieves and robbers&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s so
horrible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter did not dare to say no; nor did he dare to do what was
proposed so enticingly. He hesitated.</p>

<p>She talked sweetly and persuaded him.</p>

<p>He began to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The child was as if hypnotized.</p>

<p>O Fancy, Fancy! Where art thou? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245"

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXVIII</h2>

<p>It will be remembered that on this significant Friday a boat-race
had been arranged for the amusement of the visiting princes and
princesses. It had to be called off on account of a disinclination on
the side of the wind to fill its part of the program, or rather, to
fill the sails. For it was to have been a &ldquo;sail.&rdquo; Rowing
was not in style then; it was not considered dignified and manly.
Besides, the boats were not built to be propelled in this way.</p>

<p>The boat-race had been canceled; but the crowd remained, and
continued to discharge its enthusiasm for royalty till a late hour. It
was a great day; and the populace perspired and shouted and howled.</p>

<p>It was so hot that kings and princesses perspired like ordinary
mortals. They flourished fans indolently. At that time there was a
special kind of fan: &ldquo;<span lang="fr">joujoux de
Normandie</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was observed that the old countess-palatine manipulated her fan
more elegantly than anyone else. No doubt it was through this
&ldquo;gentle art&rdquo; that she exerted her greatest influence on
humanity.</p>

<p>Gradually the carriages of the distinguished guests disappeared, and
the knightly horsemen tired of the saddle. The day drew to a close. The
populace pushed and crowded and sang and hurrahed and drank. Fireworks
were discharged, to express, so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246"
href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>the newspapers said, the inexpressible
love of the people for princes and princesses.</p>

<p>Oh, those firecrackers, and the danger in them! Quick,
quick&mdash;throw it&mdash;a second longer and it will burst in your
hand&mdash;hurrah!</p>

<p>It was magnificent&mdash;the danger and thrilling anxiety. There was
a tradition that somebody had once held a firecracker in his hand too
long and had been badly hurt by it. This traditional
&ldquo;somebody&rdquo; was now inspiring the revelers with fresh
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>So it was on that evening, before the city authorities had
prohibited the use of fireworks. After the houses had been covered with
slate, it was thought that there was too much danger of fire in
firecrackers, but on that evening, when the houses still had thatch
roofs, the dangerous pleasure of Amsterdam youth was unrestrained.</p>

<p>And the other dangerous pleasures! How many lasses went home with
their skirts singed, some of them hardly getting home at all.
Interesting adventures! And a boy&mdash;&ldquo;those boys have to have
their noses in everything&rdquo;&mdash;yes, a youth came very near
getting a load in his face. Thrilling delight!</p>

<p>The crowd was now in the street where Juffrouw Laps resided. The
reader will recall that Walter was spending the night with her.</p>

<p>Boom! went a gun, or a cannon-cracker; and Walter awoke just as his
affectionate hostess and religious adviser was going to give him a
kiss.</p>

<p>Juffrouw Laps had burned her sinful lips. &ldquo;Lord have mercy on
us, what is that!&rdquo; she cried. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb247" href="#pb247">247</a>]</span></p>

<p>Both ran to the open window. Ordinarily a respectable Hollandish
girl never leaves her window open at night; but the extreme heat of the
evening must be urged in Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s favor.</p>

<p>It was clear to them at once that they had not been fired upon by
those &ldquo;murderers,&rdquo; for nobody paid any attention to them or
showed any interest in them. Other windows were open, as well; and on
all sides people were looking out. Right and left a cannonade of
firecrackers was going on.</p>

<p>In the interest of privacy Juffrouw Laps took the precaution to blow
out the light as quickly as possible. Another might have neglected
this.</p>

<p>Walter looked down on it all with the delight of a child. He forgot
the insistent kindness of his hostess; he thought of nothing but the
crowd below and their antics. The noise and tumult sobered him; and it
even had a quieting effect on Juffrouw Laps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How foolish the people are. They push one another hither and
thither and don&rsquo;t know themselves why they do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Click, click!&rdquo; answered an enthusiast with a gun. He
was in the midst of a bevy of girls, who scattered in an uproar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all drunk,&rdquo; said Juffrouw Laps. &ldquo;I
wish they would go home. I&rsquo;m tired&mdash;and it&rsquo;s two
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a little more!&rdquo; begged Walter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not tired&mdash;not a bit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re catching cold. For you know,
the night air after a hot day&mdash;well, put on your cap, dearest. I
wouldn&rsquo;t have this night air to give you <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>a cold for everything in
the world. Look, there goes another one.&rdquo; It was a Roman
candle.</p>

<div class="poem" lang="fr">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Amour &agrave; la plus belle.</p>

<p class="line">Honneur au plus vaillant&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they sing Dutch? Do you understand any of
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter knew something of the handsome Dunois, who slew so many Turks
and received as his reward the daughter of the duke, his master. How
would a knight be rewarded after he had already received one reward? Or
how would it have been if the master had had no daughter?</p>

<p>While Walter was asking his lady friend such difficult questions as
these, they heard an outburst of cries and abuse and oaths below. A
reaction had set in. It was a perfect riot. The crowd swayed first one
way then the other, according as one party or the other was in the
ascendency.</p>

<p>Non-combatants were pushing their way out; combatants, themselves
crowded, were crowding others. Cries of &ldquo;help&rdquo; were heard.
Mothers, with babies in their arms, attested their fear; women in
delicate health made their condition known.</p>

<p>The press was worst on the corner, whither the revelers were
streaming from three directions. Here was located a popular restaurant
and drinking-place, which was probably the destination of the stream
coming from Amstel Street. The second stream, coming from Utrecht
Street, evidently had the same objective in view. The strongest current
was flowing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249">249</a>]</span>from the belligerent group, which was now
squeezed into close quarters.</p>

<p>From his recent experience Walter knew what it meant to be in such a
mob. Whoever fell was walked over. But it really wasn&rsquo;t so bad as
that: to fall was impossible. The danger was in being crowded off the
street into basements, where limbs and necks might be easily broken. In
this respect there was more danger than there had been the evening
before in Kalver Street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christian souls!&rdquo; cried Juffrouw Laps. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
getting right sick at the stomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter&rsquo;s condition was about the same. All at once he seized
her arm. He thought that he saw somebody&mdash;somebody who looked
like&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, dear. Hold fast to me. It&rsquo;s simply
death and murder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter did not say anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it enough to run anybody crazy?&rdquo; continued
the dear Juffrouw. &ldquo;Hold fast to me, and remember that I am your
Christine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was remembering something else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid&mdash;Lord, that child&rsquo;s beside
himself&mdash;nobody shall hurt you. I will take care of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held on to her arm all the tighter; otherwise he was as if turned
to stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t pay any attention to it, sweetheart.
But&mdash;it is bad enough. Do you see that girl there with the North
Holland cap on? I wouldn&rsquo;t like to be in her place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;Femke! O God, it is Femke!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250">250</a>]</span></p>

<p>Shaking off Juffrouw Laps, who attempted to hold him back, he rushed
down the steps and in a few minutes was in the thickest of the
fray.</p>

<p>He fought his way through the crowd like a mad-man, soon reaching
the point where he had seen Femke. She, however, had disappeared. A man
with flashy cap and sailor&rsquo;s jacket, who from above had looked
like her escort, was still contending with the crowd. It seemed as if
the two had come arm in arm through Amstel Street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there a girl here with a North Holland cap on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was too busy fighting and wrestling for standing-room to
make answer. Meanwhile, Walter noticed that the fellow was struggling
toward the &ldquo;Herberge,&rdquo; and concluded that his lady must
have taken refuge there.</p>

<p>Walter paid no more attention to the punches and blows he received.
He was only concerned to give as many blows as were necessary to hasten
his arrival at the restaurant. The place was about as badly crowded as
the street, but there was no fighting going on.</p>

<p>Yes, Walter had made a good beginning: yesterday in the
&ldquo;Polish Coffeehouse,&rdquo; to-day in the &ldquo;Juniper
Berry&rdquo;&mdash;thrown in there, fighting his way in here.</p>

<p>He was in the restaurant at last, looking for Femke. Now he thought
that he had discovered her, standing on a step, or something of the
kind. With lips tightly closed, her arms crossed, the girl was looking
quietly down on the multitude as if in silent contempt. The rim was
torn from her cap and was hanging down. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb251" href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>Walter thought that he even saw
blood on her face&mdash;Femke&rsquo;s dear face!</p>

<p>He was exhausted and could not reach her. He looked at her. She did
not see him.</p>

<p>She stood there proud and haughty. He called to her. She did not
hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O God! she despises me. I deserve it for my cowardice at
Holsma&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said the woman behind the bar, &ldquo;we
don&rsquo;t have any bellowing here. If you want to bellow go to your
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Easier said than done. He couldn&rsquo;t move a peg, such was the
press. He was shoved against the counter; and it was impossible for him
to keep sight of Femke. The tears began to roll down his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing in such a crowd anyway?&rdquo; continued
the woman, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re so weak. You look as flimsy as a
dish-rag. What have you been doing? Let me give you a glass of
cognac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He would have been only too glad to pay for his place; but, as he
&ldquo;received at home everything that he needed,&rdquo; he did not
have the wherewithal. Still, there was no danger of his being thrown
out. The crowd, which was threatening to expend its remaining energy in
destroying the liquids of the place, was now occupying the
barmaid&rsquo;s attention. I should say Mrs. Goremest&rsquo;s
attention. She was the proprietress.</p>

<p>The girl continued to hold her position of advantage. There was
something scornful in her features. &ldquo;Who dares!&rdquo; she seemed
to say.</p>

<p>Walter was feeling bad. She looked over in his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>direction, but
without seeing him. He called; but she did not hear.</p>

<p>Then the fellow with the flashy cap and sailor jacket appeared in
the door. He had not been one of the belligerents; but he had suffered
the fate of neutral powers. As his clothing testified, both parties had
been his enemies.</p>

<p>So intent was the fellow on getting in that he did not even take
time to return the shoves and cuffs that he received. Twice, three
times he was crowded back; for where so many want the same thing, it
isn&rsquo;t easy to obtain. Nevertheless, he had one advantage over the
others, who sought only a resting-place and a glass of liquor. He was
incited by something else.</p>

<p>Walter hoped with all his heart that the fellow would succeed in
reaching Femke. She looked so lonely in the midst of that wild mob. If
he had been stronger, he would have&mdash;but she wouldn&rsquo;t have
anything to do with him. Wouldn&rsquo;t she push him off, just as she
did the insolent fellow who first caught hold of her apron?</p>

<p>The girl seemed now to spy the sailor. She nodded to him and smiled,
as if to encourage him. Or was she thanking him for his fidelity? Her
smile bore the message that she was uninjured, and fearless. Yes, she
stood there a statute of repose.</p>

<p>The sailor nodded back.</p>

<p>He would never have denied her, Walter thought.</p>

<p>Mrs. Goremest happened to see the new arrival; and, from the way she
greeted him, he seemed to be a frequent visitor to her place: <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253">253</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Klaas. Are you there too? You&rsquo;re out of breath,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave orders to let him through, and even came out a few steps
and helped open up the way for him.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Klaas Verlaan found standing-room at the
counter not far from Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve made the most of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He saw it the same way. He was never certain of a moment&rsquo;s
recreation before bedtime. Walter, as well as the girl who still
maintained her elevated position in the corner, agreed with the
bar-woman&rsquo;s verdict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had a good day?&rdquo; continued the woman. &ldquo;It was bad
about the boat-race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Klaas placed his finger on his mouth, as if he were going to tell
her a secret. He wanted to tell of an adventure with Princess
Erika.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A glass of corn?&rdquo; translated the bar-woman, but without
guessing the right thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half and half?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor that either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Red?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time Klaas was particularly dainty and hard to please. He
declined regularly whatever she suggested and continued to exert
himself to draw her into a more confidential talk. He had had the
pleasure of pulling Princess Erika out of the water.</p>

<p>On the outside they were still singing, &ldquo;Amour &agrave; la
plus belle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil take those Welsh songs!&rdquo; cried one of the
drinkers. &ldquo;We are Dutchmen forever!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254">254</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are Dutchman forever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And our prince&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will sing what I please; and, if anybody doesn&rsquo;t want
to sing&rdquo;&mdash;he struck himself on the chest, and the whole
party was Dutch and enthusiastic over royalty. &ldquo;Our Prince&rdquo;
was sung lustily, and to a finish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, when we were still true
Dutchmen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, when we were still true
Dutchmen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And under the republic!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long live the republic!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all ought to have seen a yacht-race then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And our prince&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the republic all men were equal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Equal. No difference at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with the tyrants!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not a bit better than we are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They suck the life out of the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they bleed us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why? Because you&rsquo;re all cowardly dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re all cowardly dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You put your necks under the yoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whenever a king comes around, or an emperor, or a prince,
then all of you are so frightened you tremble like an aspen
leaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, like an aspen leaf!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you fellows were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All men are born free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were born free and equal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And true Dutch hearts&mdash;what say you, Mrs. Goremest?
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>What
do you think, that&rsquo;s a daughter of
M&rsquo;neer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name died on the speaker&rsquo;s lips. He became pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A daughter of M&rsquo;neer&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Ask Verlaan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verlaan nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so, Klaas? Really and truly? Why then does she stand
there dressed that way&mdash;like an ordinary girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, those clothes came from my Gertie, you know. Rich people
have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, boys, we must go home now. Mother Goremest needs sleep,
too. We are not made of iron; we are flesh and blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with the tyrants! We were born free. True Dutch
hearts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh! The young lady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? That girl? What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh! The daughter of&mdash;but don&rsquo;t say a word. Damme
if it isn&rsquo;t so&mdash;the daughter of
M&rsquo;neer&mdash;Kopperlith!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kopperlith on <i>Keizersgracht</i>? What are you talking
about, man! Kopperlith&mdash;on <i>Keizersgracht</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Come, we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His daughter? His&mdash;&mdash;natural daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You understand it now; but keep quiet
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The true Dutch hearts and republicans paid and left the bar.</p>

<p>It was a sudden whim of Klaas Verlaan&rsquo;s to make his ward a
child of <i>Keizersgracht</i>; but it brought <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb256" href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>him in more ducats than he
cared to admit afterward.</p>

<p>Kopperlith? Kopperlith? on <i>Keizersgracht</i>? Femke on <i>
Keizersgracht</i>! And on the day after to-morrow he was to begin work
for this wealthy gentleman.</p>

<p>His head swam. Was he still Walter Pieterse? He doubted it. Before
he had quite come to himself, he was forced through the door with other
late stragglers. It was time for Mrs. Goremest to close.</p>

<p>The street was comparatively quiet now. Walter remained near the
&ldquo;Herberge,&rdquo; which to him was a sort of temple where his
Goddess was being worshiped. Now and then somebody else was pitched out
the door, who would have been glad to stay longer. It was not every day
that one got an opportunity to see a daughter of M&rsquo;neer
Kopperlith. Some wanted to join the triumvirate of Verlaan, the
republican speaker, and Mrs. Goremest; but the three felt themselves
strong enough to do the work and share the rewards.</p>

<p>At last the outflow ceased, and Walter was just going to peep
through the curtains of the glass door, when the door opened again and
the republican emerged. Walter heard Klaas call to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There on the corner in Paarden Street, you know<span class=
"corr" id="xd0e5559" title="Source: ,">.</span> If it costs a dollar
more, that&rsquo;s all right. Tell the cabby&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter understood. The republican was to get a cab&mdash;for
Femke?</p>

<p>Walter waited. In the meanwhile, Mrs. Goremest had locked the door
and drawn the curtains, so that it was impossible for him to look in
now. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=
"#pb257">257</a>]</span></p>

<p>In a short time a carriage drove up, and the republican sprang out
of it. The door of Mrs. Goremest&rsquo;s establishment opened again,
and Klaas Verlaan with the ostensible daughter of Kopperlith
appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Femke, I am here!&rdquo; Walter cried, hurrying to her.
&ldquo;I am here. Oh, Femke, don&rsquo;t go with the strange
men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the devil are you doing here again!&rdquo; snorted
Verlaan, seizing Walter by the collar to pull him back into the
restaurant. &ldquo;What do you want? And who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Femke, don&rsquo;t go with the strange men. I will take you
home, I, Walter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy is weak in the upper story,&rdquo; affirmed Mrs.
Goremest. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been bellowing around her the whole evening
like a calf, and he hasn&rsquo;t spent a doit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter reached for Femke&rsquo;s hand; and then he noticed how
curiously she was rigged out. She was completely covered. Of her head,
face, shoulders, figure&mdash;nothing was to be seen. Mrs. Goremest had
contributed her cloak; but what would one not do for a Kopperlith?
Still, she was saving: Only the stump of one tallow candle was burning.
It flickered strangely, giving to everything a ghostly appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you, Erich?&rdquo; the girl asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Femke, Femke, for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t go with those
strange men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tearing himself away from Verlaan, he threw himself at Femke&rsquo;s
feet. He pulled aside her cloak and covered her hand with tears and
kisses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like I tell you,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Goremest.
&ldquo;The boy is as crazy as a bedbug.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258">258</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Femke, I will never deny you again. Strike me, tread on me,
kill me, but&mdash;don&rsquo;t go with those strange men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; cried the girl peremptorily&mdash;a word that
even a Dutchman understands.</p>

<p>The republican took the candle from the counter and held it so that
the light fell on Walter&rsquo;s face. The boy was still kneeling.
Through an opening in her hood the girl looked down on him and was
silent. She did not withdraw the hand that Walter held closely pressed
to his lips.</p>

<p>Verlaan made a motion as if to remove the intruder; but the girl
stopped him with a look. Then she laid her free hand on Walter&rsquo;s
head, saying simply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another <span class="corr" id="xd0e5600" title="Source:
descendent">descendant</span> of Kopperlith!&rdquo; growled the
republican. The young people have strange ideas about how to spend the
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Walter came to his senses, he was in the street again. The
carriage had driven away&mdash;whether with her, or without her;
whether with the two men, or without them&mdash;that he did not know.
It made no difference to him: she had called him &ldquo;brother,&rdquo;
seriously, solemnly. She had spoken clearly and distinctly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O God! I thank thee. Thou art kind and compassionate. I
didn&rsquo;t know that Femke could speak like that. She must have felt
it down in her heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To-morrow, he thought, he would become immensely wealthy&mdash;in
&ldquo;business&rdquo;&mdash;and, of course, he was going to be a king
again, and still more: For Femke he would be more than a brother!
Juffrouw <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href=
"#pb259">259</a>]</span>Laps had awakened in him&mdash;well, something,
he did not know himself what it was. His heart rejoiced; he walked upon
stilts, as tired as he was, and wondered that his head did not bump
against the clouds. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXIX</h2>

<p>For anyone in Walter&rsquo;s present mood, there are only two things
in the world; self, and&mdash;nothingness!</p>

<p>Walter looked about him. &ldquo;Butter Market,&rdquo; he read on a
sign. He noticed that in the street socks could be bought, wagons
hired, etc., etc.</p>

<p>But what did it all mean? Nothing. He had kissed Femke&rsquo;s
hand!</p>

<p>It is too bad that the world did not sink out of existence on that
summer night.</p>

<p>If Walter had noticed such an occurrence, he might have asked if
Femke was hurt; otherwise the phenomenon would not have disturbed
him.</p>

<p>The reader will understand, of course, that on this eventful night
the world did not go down.</p>

<p>Walter forgave the sun for rising. He even excused the Butter Market
for being such a hot place; but it was difficult for him to convince
himself that it was not all a dream.</p>

<p>A new feeling took possession of him. His ambitious plans of a
material nature receded into the background of consciousness. His one
desire now was to love Femke&mdash;and win her love. Those continents
that were expecting salvation from him might wait.</p>

<p>He thought of Femke and her soft hand. Never had her hand felt like
that. Formerly it had seemed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href=
"#pb261">261</a>]</span>harder and rougher; but, of course, he had just
been mistaken about it. He imagined, too, that hitherto he had not
marked her voice well, nor her carriage. Surely, he had never seen the
true Femke till to-night&mdash;better, this morning.</p>

<p>But&mdash;Klaas Verlaan and his rough companions! What did all that
gab about M&rsquo;neer Kopperlith mean? There were other questions too;
but&mdash;Femke had called him brother; and that was one thing which
with him was as firm as the rock of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Brooding thus, he slipped along through the streets. Weak and tired,
he came to the &ldquo;Dam.&rdquo; Here he saw a long row of carriages.
The coachmen sat in their places waiting for the princely guests, who
had wanted to see a Holland sunrise. The sun was already in sight; but
there were no princes and princesses to see him. A few laborers were
looking on indifferently.</p>

<p>Yesterday Walter would have exerted himself to see a live, fullgrown
king, just to find out if he looked like Macbeth, or Arthur, or Lear.
To-day he was so tired that kings did not interest him.</p>

<p>He was just starting on, when the coachmen suddenly assumed a rigid
attitude. A boy remarked that &ldquo;they&rdquo; were coming now. He
was right: they did come; and all, except one old lady, drove away so
rapidly that scarcely anyone saw them. She touched her coachman on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has forgotten something,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>Three or four cavaliers stormed back into the palace and brought her
fan. While they were gone, the boys wondered at the pimples on her
face. Walter&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href=
"#pb262">262</a>]</span>pictures had had nothing of that kind. How
different Femke&rsquo;s face was!</p>

<p>Walter trudged along further; and, without thinking of where he was
going, he came to the meadow where Femke and her mother dried their
clothes. He sat down on the grass, intending to wait for the first
signs of life in Femke&rsquo;s home. He was not certain that she was
there; he did not know but that she might still be at Holsma&rsquo;s;
but there would be somebody there.</p>

<p>Overcome by weariness he lay down and gradually fell asleep. His cap
came off, rolled down into the ditch and disappeared in the mud.</p>

<p>If anyone passed by, he remarked that there lay a drunken fellow.
Yes, youth begins early. Possibly the fellow was sick; but then the
police would take care of him. Nobody hurt him; nobody touched him. His
dreams were undisturbed.</p>

<p>He dreamed of various things; but the principal object of his dreams
was a young girl, who was standing on a platform playing ball with
heavy men, as if that were nothing. Suddenly it was little Sietske
Holsma.</p>

<p>Then in his dreams he heard a voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness, boy, how did you get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first the voice was far away, then nearer, and finally quite
near. He had the dim impression that somebody was pulling him up to a
sitting posture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sietske!&rdquo; he whispered, still sleeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s my name. How did you know it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sietske&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly. Who told you? And what are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>you doing here.
It isn&rsquo;t very respectable. Are you drunk? And so young,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He called Sietske&rsquo;s name again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may call me by my first name, if you want to; but how
does it come? Did Femke tell you? It&rsquo;s a real disgrace to lie
here like a hog. What were you going to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter rubbed his eyes and felt of his head. &ldquo;I would like to
wash myself,&rdquo; he said, not yet wide awake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Claus. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re
not hurt, are you? Where is your cap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wash&mdash;with cold water,&rdquo; Walter said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Come to the pump with me.&rdquo; She led him through
the house and across the back yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid to undress here; nobody can see
you. But how did you happen to call me by my first name all at once.
Not that I&rsquo;m offended at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was still too much asleep to recall what had happened to him
during the past few hours; so he only said that he had a headache and
must wash himself first.</p>

<p>Mrs. Claus, noticing that he was ashamed to undress, hung some
quilts on the fence, thus converting the yard into a sort of room. It
never occurred to her that her own presence might embarrass him. Walter
was still not quite pleased with the outlook for a bath; but since
yesterday he had been thinking of other things as strange.</p>

<p>He began to strip, allowing Mrs. Claus to help him, just as if he
had been fifteen years younger than he was. To Mrs. Claus he was only a
child. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href=
"#pb264">264</a>]</span></p>

<p>She laid him on a bench under the spout and began to pump. At the
first drops he shivered; then the water flooded his head and shoulders.
He could neither see nor speak. His efforts to speak she interpreted as
calls for more water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this will be good for you.&rdquo; Her words were drowned
by the splashing water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hurt yourself, did you? Do you think that
will be enough now? I&rsquo;ve pumped till I&rsquo;ve got a pain in my
side. But if you think that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped all at once, but still held on to the pump handle, as if
to show her willingness to continue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot entirely to&rdquo;&mdash;she began pumping
again&mdash;&ldquo;wash you off with green soap. Femke always washes
herself with it. It makes the skin nice and smooth.&mdash;You ought to
see your back now. It shines like a looking-glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter wanted to say something but couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and your forehead, too. It&rsquo;s the green soap that
does it. I guess your mother never washes you with green soap, does
she? Then one must scour and scrub and rub. But, if you are not used to
soap&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lifted that terrible pump handle again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe this will be about enough,&rdquo; Walter blubbered.
His mouth was so full of water that again Mrs. Claus did not understand
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Green soap is good for corns, and for rheumatism.&rdquo; She
was pumping away for dear life.</p>

<p>Walter finally succeeded in rescuing himself and the bench from that
destructive stream of water. He was now able to make his cries for
mercy understood; but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href=
"#pb265">265</a>]</span>he was not yet able to get up. Besides, the
good woman had hung his clothes out of his reach, and he was ashamed.
He remained sitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want anything else?&rdquo; inquired the water
nymph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; he answered quickly. She was already
lifting the pump-handle again. &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The simple, innocent woman did not understand; and, when he
continued to sit there like a helpless lump of misery, she asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have a pain anywhere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t any pains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you tired?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was still tired, and said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I woke you up! I&rsquo;ll tell you what, you must go to
sleep and take a good nap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She began drying him off, as if that were a usual thing in her
day&rsquo;s work. Then she rolled him up in a sheet and carried him off
like a sack of clothes. He could not but notice the way she laid him
down. Then she covered him warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Straighten out your legs, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter did as she said, and experienced an indescribable feeling of
comfort. And when she punched him and patted him and tucked him in, and
said: &ldquo;Poor child, you can sleep good now. This is Femke&rsquo;s
bed, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; then he was more than comfortable;
he was delighted.</p>

<p>When he awakened at about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon he
heard whispering voices. He listened, at first to find out where he
was, and then to understand what was being said. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266">266</a>]</span></p>

<p>It seemed as if there were a plot further to confuse Sietske with
Femke in his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sietske; but what does he mean by lying out like that?
If I were his mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin, I don&rsquo;t suppose his mother knows about it.
Hermann did the same thing once. That&rsquo;s the way boys
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oho! Sietske was there; and Mrs. Claus was her cousin, and her name
was Sietske too! And that girl&mdash;there in Mrs. Goremest&rsquo;s
place?</p>

<p>His thoughts became more and more confused; though physically he
felt well.</p>

<p>How would it do, he thought, to tear a little piece out of the
sheet, so as to be able to examine it to-morrow and make certain of
himself and his adventures?</p>

<p>If he had been accustomed to fine bedlinen at home, he might now
have taken an especial pleasure in Mrs. Claus&rsquo;s extremely rough
homemade linen. Hm! He had always dreamed of princesses sleeping on
embroidered silk, among diamonds and pearls! He did not yet know that
it is possible to conceive royal and imperial highnesses otherwise at
night, and that perhaps a princess might sometimes be willing to tousle
Femke&rsquo;s bed.</p>

<p>He looked about the room. There was another small bed, where, he
supposed, Femke&rsquo;s mother slept. Across the room was the chimney.
Here were small shelves decorated with works of art. Walter noticed the
&ldquo;resurrection of Lazarus.&rdquo; Four chairs were in the room.
One was standing by his bed, and on it his clothes were carefully
arranged. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href=
"#pb267">267</a>]</span></p>

<p>In the middle of the room stood a table; and the drawer was partly
open. It was too full. Father Jansen&rsquo;s woolen socks were peeping
out while they waited for repairs. Walter wondered if those other
objectionable articles were there too.</p>

<p>On the wall, at the head of his bed, hung a crucifix, with a small
basin of holy water. With that she crosses herself, he thought. He
stuck his hand into it: it was dry. The whole arrangement was fastened
to an embroidered piece of cardboard, and, when he touched it,
something fell from behind it.</p>

<p>It looked like a large-sized letter. Walter picked it up and looked
for the address. He felt that it must be a letter from Femke to him.
Then he reproached himself, and, trembling with emotion, restored the
piece of paper to its place. He had held it up to the light: it was the
Ophelia that he had presented her after his illness! She had treasured
the picture together with the most sacred thing she possessed.</p>

<p>He was wide awake now; but who wouldn&rsquo;t wake up on receiving a
letter from Heaven?</p>

<p>He dressed himself and went into the other room, where he supposed
Mrs. Claus and Sietske were. Not a soul was to be seen. For the first
time it occurred to him that after those few words he had heard nothing
more. The girl had surely visited her &ldquo;cousin&rdquo; and then
gone away.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Claus herself? Perhaps she, too, had gone away. This was
the case; however, she had not gone out without leaving behind her a
peculiar sign of her uncouth character and lack of refinement. On a
small table, before which stood an inviting chair, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>lay two pieces of
bread and butter of her standard make. Beside them was a pot of coffee.
To be sure, it was cold now; but&mdash;well, Walter acted quickly
&ldquo;according to his convictions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other thoughts now forced themselves on his mind. The &ldquo;House
of Pieterse&rdquo; appeared to his mind&rsquo;s eye as a menacing
waterspout. In the face of this danger difficult questions that had
been clamoring for answer had to be forgotten.</p>

<p>To go home? For heaven&rsquo;s sake, no!</p>

<p>His mother, Stoffel, his sisters&mdash;all had turned into Macbethan
witches. In his imagination, even Leentje had deserted him and was
asking him to beg forgiveness for his shameful behavior. He thought of
the prodigal son; though he knew that no calf, fat or otherwise, would
be slaughtered on his return.</p>

<p><i>Sakkerloot!</i> I haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong; I
haven&rsquo;t squandered anything&mdash;not a doit of my inheritance!
Have I allowed the wine to run out? Not a drop!</p>

<p>But something must have been the matter; for&mdash;he did not dare
to go home.</p>

<p>Have I had any pleasure? Have I enjoyed any feast with four young
ladies? No! Have I allowed hounds to run around loose in the
banquet-hall? Have I had any negro servant to hold my horse?</p>

<p>There he took his stand. And he stayed there. Of camels and girls
and wine he felt that he was innocent; but himself, and his adventures
of the night, he was unable further to explain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I were a crumb of bread,&rdquo; he sighed, as he <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>stuck one
into his mouth, &ldquo;then I would know where I belong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doubtless the first crumb of bread that was ever envied by a
ruler.</p>

<p>Go to America?</p>

<p>Yes, if he only had those hundred florins that Mr. Motto had
relieved him of. Of course that worthy gentleman was now living like a
prince on the money. At least, Juffrouw Pieterse had said as much. But,
even if he had the money, he could not go away and leave Mrs.
Claus&rsquo;s house to the mercy of stray thieves and robbers. In a
way, hadn&rsquo;t he on yesterday evening taken the field against
robbers?</p>

<p>Besides, he had no cap. There was nothing in sight that looked like
a hat. Yes&mdash;there hung a North Holland cap!</p>

<p>Femke? America? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXX</h2>

<p>While Walter was looking at Femke&rsquo;s cap and revolving other
plans of escape, the door opened and Kaatje, the girl from
Holsma&rsquo;s, walked in. Not recognizing her, Walter did not
understand her when she said that Femke had sent her to ask how he was.
He looked at the messenger searchingly; then he asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to make a fool of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had puzzled over recent events till everything seemed ghostly and
unreal; and he was angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, Femke sent me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Femke? Somebody&rsquo;s grandmother again.&rdquo; He
took a step forward; and his attitude was threatening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you that giant Miller&rsquo;s sweetheart?&rdquo; taking
another step forward, while Kaatje fell back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kaatje was already outside of the door, Walter close after her with
his fists doubled up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with me? I&rsquo;m tired of being
made a fool of. You understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She retreated backwards; he pursued. It may have looked comical; but
that was the way his anger chose to express itself. In this manner the
girl returned by the same way she came, which was the footpath across
the meadow where the clothes were dried. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb271" href="#pb271">271</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, heavens! If the doctor would only come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of me?&rdquo; Walter said, punctuating his
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do <i>you</i> think I&rsquo;m drunk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no. Not at all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or crazy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&mdash;Where can the doctor be so long!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two very similar shouts put an end to the strained situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God, there he is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God, there it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One cry came from Dr. Holsma&rsquo;s coachman, who was driving up
hurriedly; the other cry meant that two boys, who were fishing in the
ditch for frogs, had caught Walter&rsquo;s cap.</p>

<p>Walter accepted his lost property without question or complaint;
while Kaatje, with tears in her eyes, ran up to Dr. Holsma to explain
what was the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it really so bad?&rdquo; asked that gentleman
presently.</p>

<p>He approached Walter, who was shaking the mud from his cap, glad to
think that he was concealing his embarrassment and fright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my boy, it&rsquo;s a good thing I met you here. I
wanted to ask you if you wouldn&rsquo;t like to take dinner with us
this evening. Afterwards we will all go out for a little amusement, if
you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the tone Walter needed to hear. He burst into tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you! That will be nice for my mother,
too.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=
"#pb272">272</a>]</span></p>

<p>Holsma motioned to Kaatje, who had timidly retired to the
background.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to Juffrouw Pieterse and tell her that the young gentleman
dines with us, and that he is going to spend the evening with
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Walter quickly,
&ldquo;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor looked at him anxiously. He was afraid that he saw
symptoms of the alleged mental disorder; but Walter&rsquo;s eye was
calm and gave no ground for fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;neer, can&rsquo;t she say too that
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out with it, my boy! What have you on your heart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I was with you&mdash;all day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holsma reflected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From early this morning&mdash;from seven o&rsquo;clock
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From seven o&rsquo;clock on,&rdquo; the doctor repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;I ate breakfast at your house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, the young gentleman ate breakfast at our house. To
be sure, he ate breakfast with us. Kaatje, you can ride in the carriage
with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Holsma helped Walter in he gave the coachman directions to stop
at Juffrouw Pieterse&rsquo;s, where &ldquo;the girl&rdquo; was
&ldquo;to leave a message.&rdquo; When he took a seat by his
prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Walter pressed his hand and exclaimed:
&ldquo;Oh, what a good fortune it is that I found you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think so? It was only a&mdash;mere accident. Mrs.
Claus is a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cousin?&rdquo; interrupted Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she&rsquo;s a good woman,&rdquo; said Holsma. <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>&ldquo;She
is a cousin of ours, and I came to visit her. I do that every week, not
as a physician, but as a kinsman. You can go to see her as much as you
like: nothing will hurt you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;neer!&rdquo; exclaimed Walter suddenly&mdash;and he
caught his breath&mdash;&ldquo;I think so much of Femke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; answered Holsma dryly. &ldquo;I do too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor was diagnosing Walter&rsquo;s case; but he preferred to
do it quietly. While speaking of indifferent things, he noted that
Kaatje had been mistaken; that Walter was both excited and exhausted,
but that his mind was unaffected. On the contrary, his mind was
growing. His soul was expanding.</p>

<p>When Kaatje left the carriage, Walter felt that the time had come to
give and receive explanations. Holsma was of a contrary opinion. He was
friendly enough, but showed no inclination for heart-to-heart
confidences. Walter&rsquo;s confusing story was promptly
interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that you&rsquo;re going to enter the world
of business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that isn&rsquo;t bad, if you get into the right hands.
You must work, though; and that&rsquo;s good for boys like
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fearing that Walter might imagine he was something more than the
average boy, Holsma continued immediately:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing for everybody, especially young
people. They&rsquo;re all alike; and all need to work. All boys must
work; and girls, too. Everybody must work.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274">274</a>]</span></p>

<p>Walter did not understand that the doctor was giving him a dose of
medicine; but he saw that the time for explanations had not yet
arrived. Still he would have felt better if he could have unburdened
his mind of at least a part of those persistent memories of last night.
His instinct of chivalry would have prevented him from mentioning the
details of the Laps affair, which, after all, had only been an
ineffective attack.</p>

<p>He began again; but the doctor interrupted him before he had hardly
mentioned the fried potatoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, such things happen to everybody. That doesn&rsquo;t
amount to anything. The thing for young people to do&mdash;and for old
people, too&mdash;is to work. It seems to be rather windy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was true. If it had only been as windy yesterday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like pictures?&rdquo; asked Holsma, when they had left
the carriage and were entering his home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Just go into that room. Look at everything as long as
you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor pushed him into the room, then ran through the hall and
up the stairs to prepare the family for Walter&rsquo;s reception.</p>

<p>Walter found little pleasure in paintings. He had had no training in
art. For him, a man with a dog and a hare was merely a man with a dog
and a hare. He felt that a poem ought to have been written about it
all; then it would have been intelligible. His glance fell on the
portrait of a woman, or a queen, or a fairy, or a mayor&rsquo;s
daughter.</p>

<p>Femke! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=
"#pb275">275</a>]</span></p>

<p>Instead of the North Holland cap she wore a diadem of sparkling
stars, or rays of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinner is ready, and papa and mamma invite you to come out to
the dining-room. Are you still sore after your fall?&rdquo; It was
little Sietske.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean from your fall on the table in the coffee-house. How
comical! Well, if you are all right again, we&rsquo;re going out this
evening&mdash;papa, mamma, William, Hermann, you, I&mdash;all!
We&rsquo;re going to the theatre!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sietske had understood her orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going out?&mdash;to the theatre? But my
mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa will attend to that. Don&rsquo;t worry; he will arrange
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once out in the hall, Walter hesitated again. He motioned to Sietske
and took her back into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sietske, who is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a great-great-great-great-grandmother of
ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she looks like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like Femke! Of course. Like me, too. When Hermann puts on
such a cap you can&rsquo;t tell him from Femke. Come, now. We
mustn&rsquo;t keep mamma waiting.<span class="corr" id="xd0e5971"
title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>On entering the dining-room Walter was met by that quiet cordiality
that the doctor had prescribed. When all were seated Sietske mentioned
the picture again in apologizing to Walter for hurrying him away from
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; remarked the doctor quietly, &ldquo;there is some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href=
"#pb276">276</a>]</span>resemblance; but Femke is not so pretty. No,
not by a great deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cold douche!</p>

<p>Walter had never thought of Femke&rsquo;s beauty. He really did not
know whether the girl was pretty, or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you take some sauce, Walter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had called him brother, so solemnly, and with such a mien! Of
course the lady in the portrait, with the sparkling diadem, would hold
out her hand the same way. Walter made an awkward gesture with his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Salad?&rdquo; asked Sietske.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be crowded,&rdquo; said Mevrouw Holsma.
&ldquo;Everyone will want to see the kings and princes. We
haven&rsquo;t asked our guest yet if he wants to go. We&rsquo;re going
to the theatre; would you like to go with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was charmed at the prospect. He had never been in a theatre,
but had long wanted to see such a play as Leentje had described. He
cared nothing for kings. He would have given a dozen kings for one
baron carrying away a girl in the approved manner. The Glorioso
influence was still on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see half of the sovereigns of Europe,&rdquo; said
Holsma, &ldquo;and a dozen candidates&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter wondered what the candidates would do in the
&ldquo;comedy.&rdquo; Sietske explained.</p>

<p>There was still plenty of time. Holsma was going out to see a
patient and promised to stop at Juffrouw Pieterse&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>For reasons of fashion and feminine finery the play was not to begin
till nine o&rsquo;clock. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href=
"#pb277">277</a>]</span></p>

<p>Walter heard that Femke, too, was to witness the performance; and
from the conversation he gathered that the relations existing between
the aristocratic family and the poor wash-girl were most cordial.
Mevrouw Holsma sent Sietske to ask Femke to come in; but Femke
preferred to remain with little Erich, with whom she was playing at the
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Erich?&rdquo; thought Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; said Mevrouw Holsma.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why she wasn&rsquo;t at the table. She would rather
stay with the baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says, too, that we sit at the table too long for
her,&rdquo; added Sietske.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy the play anyway,&rdquo; observed
William. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good girl, but she&rsquo;s a little
thick-headed. Don&rsquo;t you think so, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone must act according to his own convictions, and
consult his own tastes. Femke is too good to be forced to
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There must have been some special reason why the mother was going to
the theatre with the rest, when she preferred to stay at home with
little Erich, who had the measles. But she was going to remain
&ldquo;only a little while,&rdquo; and then come back with Uncle
Sybrand. He would return to the theatre taking Femke with him, if she
cared to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call it thick-headedness,&rdquo; affirmed William.
&ldquo;She just don&rsquo;t want to put on a fine dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t want to be a fine lady,&rdquo; said the
mother. &ldquo;She is very sensible and fears that this might disturb
her relations with her mother. We ought to have taken her when she was
little; but Mrs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href=
"#pb278">278</a>]</span>Claus couldn&rsquo;t give her up then. And now
Femke can&rsquo;t give herself up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only stubborn,&rdquo; William explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is proud,&rdquo; corrected his mother, &ldquo;too proud
to appear other than she is. She wouldn&rsquo;t exchange places with a
princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Sybrand came. He announced that the &ldquo;Scylla&rdquo; of
Rotgans was to be given, followed by &ldquo;Chloris,&rdquo; with
something else as a close. Holsma had already returned, bringing Walter
the assurance that it was all right with his mother.</p>

<p>Walter was enchanted in anticipation. Was he still thinking of
Femke?</p>

<p>William said: &ldquo;So far as I&rsquo;m concerned she can stay at
home. Suppose the students were to see me with a peasant girl! What
would they do for me when I enter college in September?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such an Amsterdamer calls everybody a &ldquo;peasant,&rdquo; even if
he is a student and able to explain what sort of a &ldquo;Scylla&rdquo;
that was.</p>

<p>All were now dressed and starting. Walter was to see his first
&ldquo;comedy,&rdquo; and, perhaps, take a part in one. <span class=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXXI</h2>

<p>Good Muse, sweet Muse, take us back to Pieterseville again. Whisper
to me and tell me what happened there during Walter&rsquo;s romantic
enchantment; and have a care that my language rises to the dignity of
the subject.</p>

<p>We know already, Clio, how the mistress of the castle saw her
progeny depart to protect the distressed lady from the nefarious
attacks of robbers and murderers; how her blessing and the consecrated
blade were withheld, and how the brave youth sallied forth with a
nightcap his only weapon. We know, too, how the bachelor Stoffel, the
hereditary custodian of the reputation of the family&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah, let us treat the matter quite simply, and leave the muse
alone.</p>

<p>On the Friday evening in question Juffrouw Pieterse went to bed as
usual. The others did the same. There were no indications of bad
dreams. There was no trace of anxiety over the terrible danger to which
Walter had thoughtlessly exposed himself. This might have been because
they did not know of the danger. It had not been at all necessary for
Juffrouw Laps to conceal her intention so slyly and always omit
Walter&rsquo;s name from the knighthood of the Pieterse family. Thanks
to the <span class="corr" id="xd0e6049" title="Source: stupdity">
stupidity</span> of the family, she might have gained her point without
any finesse.</p>

<p>Saturday morning dawned, that morning on which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>Mrs. Claus
applied the restoratives so abundantly, and so efficaciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder where in the world the boy can be so long?&rdquo;
said the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he got up very early; and then maybe
she had him to read a chapter out of the Bible at breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This explanation by Stoffel quieted the family for half an hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would it do for you to go over there?&rdquo; Juffrouw
Pieterse proposed at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going, mother. You know it isn&rsquo;t on my
way to school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was a sufficient reason. Never do anything that isn&rsquo;t on
your way&mdash;one of the favorite maxims of conservatism. Stoffel
himself did not know how profound was the wisdom of his political
aphorism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would it do, then, to send Leentje over to Juffrouw
Laps&rsquo;s to inquire about Walter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This proposal met with approval, and Leentje was dispatched
forthwith.</p>

<p>Oh, poor Juffrouw Laps! She was &ldquo;the most wretched woman in
the world;&rdquo; and the room from which Walter had fled so suddenly
was now the temple of all the heterogeneous griefs and pains that
novelists ever make use of.</p>

<p>I will not place Walter above Joseph, Theseus, Jason or Hippolytos.
May Apollo preserve me from such blind partiality. Not by any means do
I regard my hero as the most interesting mortal that ever left a woman
in the lurch. No, not in Walter&rsquo;s worth do I seek for the measure
of the forsaken lady&rsquo;s despair. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb281" href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>Indeed, Juffrouw Laps&rsquo;s pain
was not caused by any reflections as to the beauty or excellence of the
vanished knight. There was another element in the matter that was
filling her with horror and driving her to distraction. With all due
respect for the suffering of other abandoned ladies, Asnath, Ariadne,
Medea, Phaedra&mdash;but Juffrouw Laps had to face Walter&rsquo;s
family. That was the trouble.</p>

<p>Her fertile brain evolved the most wonderful plans. How would it do
for her to tell that he had been carried away in a fiery chariot before
the eyes of the people, like Elias of old? She discarded the idea, for
fear that no one would believe it.</p>

<p>At first she had waited at the window, watching for her little
Theseus to return. When she saw him no more she thought that perhaps
the mob had carried him off with them. That was not an unpleasant
thought; since her fear for his return to his family was greater than
her desire for his return to her. This is easily understood: what might
he not tell at home?</p>

<p>It was already daylight; but Juffrouw Laps knew that it was too
early to go to the Pieterses&rsquo;. Besides, what would she say? That
her little knight had run away during the night? And why? Whither? How
did she know but that he had already told the story in all its
details?</p>

<p>She determined&mdash;not to determine upon anything, and to leave
the matter with the &ldquo;Master&rdquo; for the present. With this
pious resolve she climbed into her maidenly bed; and, before falling
asleep, she groaned: &ldquo;If the rascal had only broken his neck,
like the high priest Eli, in First Samuel, 4!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282">282</a>]</span></p>

<p>No doubt the Master saw the distress of his faithful disciple and
taught her how to meet the situation that awaited her waking; for
Leentje soon returned with the assurance of Juffrouw Laps that Walter
was out taking a morning walk.</p>

<p>In a way, this was the truth. The Juffrouw merely neglected to add
why he was taking a walk, and at what hour in the morning he had gone
out. Leentje, suspecting nothing, asked no questions. For her it was a
&ldquo;matter of course&rdquo; that he would not go out in the middle
of the night.</p>

<p>The family now regarded the incident as fresh evidence of
Walter&rsquo;s objectionable habit of roving, and nothing more. They
felt no anxiety for his personal safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;The trouble
and vexation I have with that boy. Anybody else would sit down for a
while after breakfast; but he&mdash;what does he do? He runs away
before it&rsquo;s hardly daylight. Is that any way to do,
Stoffel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to leave us here anxious and worrying over
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a nice caper he&rsquo;s cutting again. He knows very
well that we&rsquo;re all uneasy and won&rsquo;t have a minute&rsquo;s
peace till he comes. God only knows where he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stoffel could not wait to hear more. It was time for him to go to
school.</p>

<p>It may be repeated that there was not a word of truth in all this
uneasiness and anxiety. The family <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"
href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>considered such a display to be the proper
thing; though, for the rest, they did not manifest the slightest
interest in Walter&rsquo;s fate. For aught they knew some accident
might have happened to the boy; but, instead of making a serious effort
to find out what had become of him, his mother found it easier to
accuse him of indecorous conduct and general worthlessness.</p>

<p>Thus matters remained until Dr. Holsma&rsquo;s carriage drove up
before Juffrouw Pieterse&rsquo;s door that afternoon and Kaatje
alighted with her message. After the recent fright Walter had given
her, she was glad enough to escape from such close proximity to the
young lunatic. For thus she regarded him.</p>

<p>All rushed to the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is; there he is!&rdquo; cried the whole family in a
breath, and as loud as they could. &ldquo;Did you ever! Really,
he&rsquo;s sitting there in Dr. Holsma&rsquo;s carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This flattering observation banished everything else from their
thoughts, and made Kaatje&rsquo;s task an easy one. It was now a simple
matter for her to allay their fears. They were no longer concerned to
know where Walter <i>had been</i>. It was enough that he was now in Dr.
Holsma&rsquo;s carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ate breakfast at the doctor&rsquo;s? Girl, you don&rsquo;t
say so! And&mdash;and&mdash;why isn&rsquo;t the coachman wearing his
furs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kaatje was dumbfounded and could only stammer some reference to the
season. In fact, the manner in which her message was being received
strengthened her worst suspicions of Walter&rsquo;s sanity. It seemed
to her that the entire family was a little &ldquo;off.&rdquo; <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284">284</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And he really ate breakfast at the doctor&rsquo;s? Do you
understand, Trudie? Ate breakfast at Dr. Holsma&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he ate breakfast with us. To be sure he did. The doctor
himself said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Dr. Holsma&rsquo;s, and ate breakfast there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly. Where else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did he use the good manners I&rsquo;ve taught
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Juffrouw! But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is he now in the carriage with the doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Juffrouw&mdash;naturally!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, my dear,&rdquo; continued the proud mother, &ldquo;I
am going to tell you something; but you need not repeat it to anybody
else. Don&rsquo;t you know, that&rsquo;s an unusual child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed Kaatje, thoroughly convinced, &ldquo;I
know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know it, don&rsquo;t you? And do you know why? I&rsquo;m
going to tell you. He&rsquo;s an unusual child, because&mdash;Pietro,
move away a little, and you, too, Mina. Trudie, you can stay where you
are, but pay attention to your knitting!&mdash;he&rsquo;s an unusual
child, don&rsquo;t you know, because, before he was born, you
understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Juffrouw!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, I dreamed of a butterfly; and it was dragging
off an elephant! You understand now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Juffrouw. I understand exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see? That&rsquo;s the reason. Give the doctor
my politest regards, and thank him for me. If <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb285" href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>he&rsquo;s only
well-behaved&mdash;I mean Walter. And the coachman wears such a fur cap
only in the winter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kaatje managed to escape, fully resolved never to dream of elephants
and butterflies. Such an indulgence seemed to her to be particularly
dangerous; for she now began to think in all seriousness that the whole
family was crazy, and that what she had seen in Walter was merely a
sample of the general disorder.</p>

<p>When a few hours later the doctor himself stopped at Juffrouw
Pieterse&rsquo;s, her joy over Walter&rsquo;s exaltation know no
bounds. Holsma took note of the stupid woman&rsquo;s foibles and
follies, and resolved to prescribe an intellectual diet for Walter that
would counteract their influence.</p>

<p>Poor Juffrouw Laps! If she had only known how happily everything had
turned out, how much worry she might have spared herself! In the
seclusion of her own room she was still quoting the Bible and fighting
for her honor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href=

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXXII</h2>

<p>The reader is now invited to return to the theatre party, from which
he was called suddenly away by the anxiety experienced in certain
quarters over Walter&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>

<p>The family took their seats, in the parquet this time, having had to
give up their box to visiting potentates. The box was still
unoccupied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A comedy!&rdquo; Walter thought. He looked about him and
listened.</p>

<p>The house was crowded, and everyone was talking. Backstairs gossip
and court scandals were passed around. People were wondering who would
sit there, and who would sit <i>there</i>. Later arrivals were pushing
at one another and quarreling about seats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The programs for the princes are printed on silk. What do you
suppose it cost a yard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rotgans is one of the first poets!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm! Better say one of the second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a poet of the seventh class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, one of his plays? We have poets whose song is as
clear as a bell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Bilderdyk! A Ph&oelig;nix!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, these foreigners don&rsquo;t understand a word of it
anyway, and it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference what the play
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity about Floris.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287">287</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s something behind that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bilderdyk is a patriot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A genuine Hollander!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A genuine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will give those foreigners something to think
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh!&mdash;&mdash; ... not much flattery. No Hollander is
going to do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody stood up. A footman appeared in the royal box, probably to
see whether the cushions were straight on the chairs, or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea, the very idea of standing up before a
lackey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was enough to make them indignant; but they had done it, even
those who protested loudest. There were city aldermen in the number,
and doctors, and professors, and prominent business men, including,
perhaps, the great Kopperlith.</p>

<p>Another period of babbling and waiting; then another footman
appeared. Again everybody sprang to his feet. Again all, except the
silent Holsmas, railed at such stupidity.</p>

<p>The crowd became more restless. Innumerable times were they fooled
by some footman or other, who opened a door to break the monotony. The
people were already beginning to complain, but softly, cautiously.</p>

<p>Walter was carried away with the elegance and magnificence of it
all. One thing, however, jarred upon his sense of propriety: he
wondered how such swell folk could say such commonplace things. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href=
"#pb288">288</a>]</span>Holsmas said nothing. Only once, when Uncle
Sybrand pointed to a certain box, did they join in the general
hubbub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will sit there, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be sorry if I have left little Erich all for
nothing,&rdquo; said Mevrouw Holsma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe with Femke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I had rather be with him myself. The child is sick.
I&rsquo;m not going to wait much longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s doubtful whether she will come with the others.
I&rsquo;ve heard that she&rsquo;s full of moods and mischief. She cares
nothing for convention. It seems to run in the blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she isn&rsquo;t here by ten o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;m going.
I don&rsquo;t care much about it, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This conversation occupied Walter for a short time. Who was this
person on whose account Mevrouw Holsma had left the bedside of her sick
child?</p>

<p>The tension of expectancy was broken, and a momentary excitement
pulsed through the multitude. All arose to their feet, and remained
standing.</p>

<p>An emperor, or something of the kind, entered the royal box. Walter
could see little; but he inferred what was going on from whisperings he
heard about him. His majesty had made a quick rush for his chair,
turning over a few other chairs in so doing. That was a habit of his.
Then he looked about the auditorium for a moment with squinted eyes,
jerked up his chair and fell into it. He was in a hurry. The public was
now at liberty to take their seats.</p>

<p>The other boxes were now filled quickly, as if by a stroke of magic.
Remarkable costumes were on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href=
"#pb289">289</a>]</span>exhibition. There were bodices three inches
wide, with skirts of as many yards. Voluptuous bosoms hovered between
chin and girdle. Scanty sleevelets did not know whether they were to
cover arms or shoulders. The ladies wore kid gloves reaching to their
armpits, and on their heads were turbans and flower-gardens. The
uniforms of the gentlemen were even more conspicuous. Those shakos! The
enemy would have run at the sight of them.</p>

<p>The orchestra began to play. It was that song about the brave
Dunois, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arise!&rdquo; someone called; and all scrambled to their feet
again in honor of the brave hero.</p>

<p>The curtain went up.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Yes, Minos, on the present that I gave to
thee&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">&rsquo;Twas stolen from the
church&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;What church?&rdquo; asked Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; from William. &ldquo;Poetic license. You will see
how it is.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;hangs Nisus&rsquo; crown and
life.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Qu&rsquo;est-ze qu&rsquo;elle
changte?</span>&rdquo; cried the countess-palatine. Then she let
herself out on costumes, speaking in a noisy voice.</p>

<p>Walter listened like a finch. Not that he understood very well; but
everything strange interested him intensely.</p>

<p>Not a soul was touched by the tragic bravery of King Minos; no one
was listening. Poor Rotgans! Afterwards it was said that Napoleon had
been especially pleased with &ldquo;our Snoel&rdquo; and with
&ldquo;our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href=
"#pb290">290</a>]</span>Watlier.&rdquo; Goodness, Napoleon! When he was
to be crowned he had Talma the mimic to drill him for the
ceremony&mdash;instead of saying to Talma: &ldquo;Look, this is the way
an emperor appears when he&rsquo;s crowned!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter listened attentively; even though he sometimes felt that he
could make such verses himself.</p>

<p>During the performance another commotion arose. One of their
majesties had asked for a glass of orange lemonade; and this was
something the buffetier did not have. A runner was dispatched to the
drug-store post haste. He returned with a bottle of lemon-syrup. The
situation became threatening. The news spread like fire that they were
making a &ldquo;Majesty&rdquo; wait for such a trifle. King Minos
declared:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Feelings of pleasure thrill my inner
man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="fr">De l&rsquo;eau de fleur d&rsquo;orange! que
diantre!</span>&rdquo; cried a chamberlain. And Minos noticed that
nobody was interested in what was going on in his interior.</p>

<p>A confectioner up on &ldquo;Olympus&rdquo; allowed his light to
flash out and gave some valuable information; but the police had him by
the collar in a jiffy. He was to be dragged away and put in confinement
for the present. The technical charge was, &ldquo;Making a
demonstration for the House of Orange.&rdquo; At that time the House of
Orange was in exile, and Napoleon&rsquo;s brother was king of
Holland.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Feelings of pleasure thrill my inner
man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>repeated Minos with gusto. The conductor of the orchestra seized his
baton and was going to play, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href=
"#pb291">291</a>]</span>&ldquo;Hail to the Emperor.&rdquo; Many stood
up in readiness to escape in case of danger.</p>

<p>In the meantime the prisoner was screaming as if he were possessed;
but the two Italian police that Napoleon had brought with him could not
understand a word.</p>

<p>The emperor himself had forgotten that he had called for orange
water and was now engrossed in a military map.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Qu&rsquo; a-t-il?&rdquo; he seemed to be asking the lady next
to him.</p>

<p>Minos had begun again and was once more repeating his assurance that
&ldquo;feelings of pleasure thrill&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter noted that the grown-up members of the Holsma party did not
pay the slightest attention to the play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t come soon, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo;
Mevrouw Holsma repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s sitting further back in the
emperor&rsquo;s box, where we can&rsquo;t see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that in Paris she never stays fifteen
minutes in the same place. Maybe we shall find her somewhere
else,&rdquo; remarked another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not going to wait but five minutes longer. My little
Erich is worth more to me than a thousand
cousins&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the king,&rdquo; added Holsma.</p>

<p>Walter had thought that they meant Femke. What, then, could be so
interesting about the princess? The boxes were full of them.</p>

<p>At the close of the third act Mevrouw Holsma left with Uncle
Sybrand, who was to return with Femke. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb292" href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>&ldquo;If she will come,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;For she cares nothing for such a fuss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter knew better. Uncle Sybrand ought to have seen her in the
&ldquo;Juniper Berry.&rdquo; But a knight tells no tales.</p>

<p>Old Minos is insanely in love with Ismene, who is so beautiful and
virtuous. Scylla is insanely in love with Minos, who is old and
dignified. Ismene is in love with Focus, who is a hero; and, possibly,
Focus loves Ismene, though he does not treat her quite gallantly. He
says to her:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Princess, thy reasons spare: to me they&rsquo;re
odious!<span class="corr" id="xd0e6328" title="Not in
source">&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>

<p>The tumult on Mount Olympus began afresh. Had the rebellious
confectioner returned? All eyes were directed toward the gallery. A
policeman in uniform was seen remonstrating in vain with some men on
the front seat. In order to make them understand his French, or
Italian, he was pulling at their arms. They were to understand that he
did not want to arrest them, or kill them, but merely wanted them to
give up their seats.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Princess, thy reasons spare: to me they&rsquo;re
odious!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Qu&rsquo; y a-t-il encore?&rdquo; asked the emperor again;
and, when one of the chamberlains answered his question, he laughed
heartily. Heads were together everywhere. Something interesting was
going forward on Mount Olympus. People whispered and tittered and
laughed outright. Their eyes were fastened on the gallery. Even the
emperor stood up and leaned out of his box. But it did no good: he
could not see around the corner. He was surprised at this. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293">293</a>]</span></p>

<p>The countess-palatine, however, had got to the bottom of the matter.
She was exchanging telegraphic messages with someone in the background
on Mount Olympus. No one was thinking of Rotgans&rsquo; play.</p>

<p>She was greeting someone with that famous fan. Whom? The rebellious
confectioner? With arms extended she was testifying that there was
something extraordinary up there among that rabble.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Princess, thy reasons spare: to me they&rsquo;re
odious!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The countess-palatine threw off all restraint, and laughed and
laughed. After the emperor had laughed hilarity was permissible. Her
pleasure was beyond her control.</p>

<p>I should have to have a double pen to report what Uncle Sybrand said
on his return, and, at the same time, reproduce the exclamation that
escaped Walter, who was looking towards the gallery with eyes and mouth
wide open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Femke?&rdquo; asked Holsma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t want to come,&rdquo; replied Uncle Sybrand.
&ldquo;Just as I said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; cried Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Femke, M&rsquo;neer, Femke, Femke&mdash;that is Femke! And
she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl above had taken hold of the policeman by the collar and,
pushing him to one side, had pressed forward to the front row. There
she had seated herself on the laps of the fellows the policeman had
been <span class="corr" id="xd0e6361" title="Source: negotiationg">
negotiating</span> with in vain. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294"
href="#pb294">294</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Femke, M&rsquo;neer. If only they don&rsquo;t hurt
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the emperor stood up and stared at Mount Olympus. He saw the
girl with the North Holland cap and nodded to her. The
countess-palatine greeted again with her fan, as if she would
congratulate her on securing the seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, M&rsquo;neer, it is Femke,&rdquo; cried Walter, amazed
that he received no answer.</p>

<p>Even Holsma and Sybrand were surprised, but not so much so as
Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, children,&rdquo; said Holsma, &ldquo;you can tell your
mother that we saw her.&rdquo; And to Walter he continued, &ldquo;That
girl is a relation of ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Femke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that isn&rsquo;t her name; and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;neer, don&rsquo;t I know Femke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That sounded quite different from what Walter had said that evening
when he &ldquo;denied&rdquo; her.</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s big blue eyes, roving about the hall, suddenly fell
on Walter. She bent over, looked him attentively in the face, then
nodded to him and threw him a kiss.</p>

<p>At least, he thought it was that way; and it was that way. But
everyone in the parquet thought that the kiss had been intended for
him. Folk of quality were annoyed at the insolence of the peasant
wench; while more &ldquo;sporty&rdquo; persons returned the
attention.</p>

<p>Soon hissing was heard. The news had leaked out that Princess Erika,
the cousin of the king, had dressed in the national costume to show her
affection for the people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href=
"#pb295">295</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it, M&rsquo;neer? I tell you that is
Femke,&rdquo; Walter assured him with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, my boy. That girl is not Femke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, she greeted me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You saw the emperor greet her; and you know he would not
salute a wash-girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was perhaps true; but it was hard for Walter to accept it. And,
on the other hand, it was just as hard for him to believe that the
princess was a cousin of the Holsmas.</p>

<p>Again he imagined that the girl was nodding to him and motioning her
lips. It looked to him as if she said: &ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; Walter
lisped the words after her and pressed both hands to his breast.</p>

<p>Yes, now he had it! They considered him a little daft and wanted to
cure him of his fixed idea. That would explain the visit to the theatre
and also Femke&rsquo;s alleged unwillingness to come with Uncle
Sybrand. But&mdash;how did she dare to interfere with the policeman?
And the greeting from the emperor? And how did Holsma know that he had
&ldquo;denied&rdquo; Femke, and that her presence could threaten his
peace of mind?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, M&rsquo;neer, let Femke sit here! I will be perfectly
quiet. I am so afraid she will get hurt up there among those
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holsma looked at him wistfully. After all, could Kaatje have been
right about it? He sought to distract Walter&rsquo;s attention by
referring to other things; but it was useless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Holsma at last &ldquo;I just wanted to
tease you a little. Femke is sitting up there, because <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href=
"#pb296">296</a>]</span>she&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t wish to sit here. She
thinks that it wouldn&rsquo;t be proper, because she&rsquo;s only a
wash-girl. She&rsquo;s afraid we would be ashamed. You see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;neer, no one need be ashamed to sit by her. Not even
the emperor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; agreed Holsma. &ldquo;Quite so. Femke is a
brave girl and doesn&rsquo;t need to cringe before anybody. Watch the
play, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was willing to do what the doctor said, but not without
taking leave of that glorious apparition. He looked up; and she smiled
to him again. Then she took from her breast a rose branch, with three
buds on it, held it <span class="corr" id="xd0e6418" title="Not in
source">a</span> moment between the forefinger and thumb of her left
hand, pointed to Walter with her right and let it fall.</p>

<p>The rosebuds landed on the bald pate of a stout gentleman near the
Holsma party. He seized them and examined them admiringly; but, before
he could decide what to do with them, Walter had sprung over half a
dozen chairs and deprived him of the precious property. With a glance
toward Olympus, Walter pressed the roses to his lips. Princess Erika
nodded approval; and the playful countess-palatine applauded
lustily.</p>

<p>That was more than Walter could bear. He had never forgiven himself
for denying her; but she, the noble, the big-hearted, the majestic
one!&mdash;she had proclaimed her pardon publicly before the people.
And that was why she preferred to sit in the gallery. She had washed
away the black spots from his soul; she had restored his soiled
chivalry. These thoughts flashed through Walter&rsquo;s mind like
lightning. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href=
"#pb297">297</a>]</span></p>

<p>He sank to the floor in a faint. But was it any wonder?</p>

<p>The Holsmas took him home with them for the night; and another
message was sent to Juffrouw Pieterse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Stoffel? Just as I said! I don&rsquo;t
care if <span class="corr" id="xd0e6432" title="Source: eveybody">

<h2 class="normal">Chapter XXXIII</h2>

<p>The next morning, Sunday, the doctor invited Walter into his study.
He spoke to him sympathetically and encouraged the boy to lay his case
before him; though he avoided everything that might make Walter believe
that his experiences were anything extraordinary. He already knew more
about it than Walter could tell. Even Walter&rsquo;s adventure with
Juffrouw Laps was perfectly transparent to him. There was nothing lost
to him because of the boy&rsquo;s lack of skill in handling the
story.</p>

<p>While Walter poured out to him his inner experiences, Holsma
listened quietly, as if it was all familiar to him. Walter&rsquo;s
reverence and passion for the good he interpreted as a commonplace
phenomenon incident to budding youth. He treated the boy&rsquo;s love
for Femke as an ordinary matter. He admitted that it had been exactly
the same way with him when he was a boy&mdash;a method that few parents
and educators seem to be familiar with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly, my boy. In such moods a fellow would
like to be everywhere at the same time, ruling, regulating and putting
things into order. He feels that he&rsquo;s responsible for everything;
and it hurts him to see so much crookedness in the world. I know very
well how it is. But you must consider the means <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>and remedies at your
disposal. How are you going to begin to improve things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think that everyone is bad? I suppose you hardly think
that. There are plenty of people in the world who wish for the same
things that you are worrying about. Why don&rsquo;t they change the
world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Walter was silent. The very simplicity with which Holsma put
the question disconcerted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try to help you out. Do you believe that I am a good
man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Walter enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think so? Well, I think so too. I should be ashamed not
to be able to say that. Why don&rsquo;t I reform the world? You often
speak of Africa. That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know that
country, my boy. And I, who am a good man, have not abolished slavery.
Why not, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter returned no answer. Holsma was busy with a surgical
operation. Is it any wonder that the patient tried to withdraw the
member that was being cut away?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will present the matter to you differently. Do you hear
that knocking and hammering? Listen! That comes from the
blacksmith&rsquo;s shop over there. It isn&rsquo;t so bad on Sunday;
but you can easily imagine that the noise sometimes disturbs
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In case of sickness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and also when I wish to think. And then I should like to
see the blacksmiths swept away&mdash;quick&mdash;just like that! But
why don&rsquo;t I do it?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300"
href="#pb300">300</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;because you can&rsquo;t,
M&rsquo;neer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right. For the same reason I have not yet corrected any
of the wrongs in Africa. Nor in Asia; nor in America; nor in other
countries that I might mention. But yesterday evening, when you were
taken sick in the theatre, I brought you home with me and put you to
bed. Then I sent a messenger to quiet your mother. That was my duty,
wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;No thanks, my boy. It seemed to me to be my duty; and I did
it&mdash;because I could. Whatever is impossible, is not my duty; and
that&rsquo;s the reason I don&rsquo;t take those blacksmiths between my
thumb and forefinger and transport them to some other clime. For the
same reason I don&rsquo;t fret over doings in Africa. Impossible duty
is no duty; and running after the impossible interferes with the
performance of real duties. At school did you ever fail to know a
lesson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, very often! But not lately; because
Femke&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave Femke out of account for the present. I may say
something about her another time. When you were neglecting your books
at school, you were thinking of other things, things far removed from
your work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a mistake that many young people
make&mdash;don&rsquo;t be offended: I did the same thing&mdash;and
usually on account of laziness. It is more convenient to imagine
one&rsquo;s self soaring over the distant mountain top than to lift a
foot and step over the stone just in front of one. Of all the million
things that you would like to do there are only a very few that you can
do. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=
"#pb301">301</a>]</span>Busy yourself with these few. That is the way
to succeed. Whatever comes up, always ask: &lsquo;What is my immediate
duty?&rsquo; Will you promise to do this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter gave Holsma his hand on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you would like to know more, my boy? I would, too. What
lies before you? Well, you are behind in your studies. Other boys of
your age know more. We will speak of that again, however; for that is
something to be attended to later, and does not come under the head of
immediate duty. That smattering of Latin, for which you envy William,
you can acquire in a few months, when once you&rsquo;ve learned how to
use your will. The enemies you have to fight now are quite different
from the knights of your romances. Do not underestimate the
difficulties you will have to contend with. That might result in your
defeat. You must learn to use your intellectual faculties at will; and
keep a firm grip on &lsquo;Fancy,&rsquo; or else she will throw you
head over heels. Dreaming is not living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walter nodded assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True manliness,&rdquo; Holsma continued, &ldquo;means, to do
what has to be done, no difference how insignificant it may be. What
would you think of a lot of knights, who let tramps beat them over the
heads because their code of honor did not allow them to fight with
tramps? You are going into business now: come to me in a month and tell
me if you have kept your word. Then we will speak further;
but&mdash;that first! Will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I shall keep my word, M&rsquo;neer. But,
M&rsquo;neer, may I ask&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb302" href="#pb302">302</a>]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;About Femke? Well, that is a good, brave girl. She&rsquo;s a
cousin of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did she happen to be&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young lady in the theatre wasn&rsquo;t Femke. That was
Princess Erika. We wanted to see her because her ancestors were related
to ours. You rogue, you! There was nothing special about
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A real princess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and Femke is a real wash-girl. I hope that Princess
Erika has as admirable a character as Femke. But don&rsquo;t attribute
too much importance to this, my boy. Such differences in related
families are of frequent occurrence, whether one notices them, or not.
There was a time when Erika&rsquo;s forefathers dressed themselves in
skins; and mine did the same. We don&rsquo;t know whether she is aware
that she has relations here or not. Uncle Sybrand found out&mdash;well,
he takes a sort of pleasure in tracing out the identity of opposites.
Rightly understood, the world is smaller than you imagine; everything
is a link in the same sequence. Who knows but that you may turn the
course of history to-morrow, when you go to work for&mdash;what is the
style of the firm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ouwetyd &amp; Kopperlith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, when you go to work for Ouwetyd &amp; Kopperlith. But,
whether it&rsquo;s to be an historical event, or not, perform your
immediate duty. That is the chivalrous, manly thing for you to
do&mdash;if you will take my advice. Will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, M&rsquo;neer! But&mdash;Femke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again! She has nothing to do with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>your immediate
duty. The lady that you must attend upon and serve faithfully
is&mdash;who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do <span class="corr" id="xd0e6515" title="Source: your">
you</span> mean &lsquo;Business&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right. If you are determined to know more about Femke, I will
tell you what she says. She says that for the present you must think of
nothing but your work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will, I will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For about ten years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten years? Ten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is what she said when she heard how little you know
and how little you can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is what she said. Perhaps eight, perhaps twelve,
perhaps twenty. One cannot say exactly beforehand. You understand that,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. It will give me pleasure&mdash;and Femke, too.
Don&rsquo;t imagine it will be particularly difficult. Ten years ago
thousands began just where you will begin to-morrow; and they are still
alive. So, you see, it can be done. Besides, think only of the first
month; and then the time will seem shorter. I shall expect you to come
to see me in about a month; then we shall have more to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Walter left, he promised again to banish all boyish follies
from his thoughts. But he put away the rosebuds; and he kept them.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
